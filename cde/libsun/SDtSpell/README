This is regarding source files in the libsun/SDtSpell directory:

The spell engine source code is third party and we can't deliver it.
It is in libsun/SDtSpellE and libsun/SDtSpell/SDtSpellE.

This directory has code for the GUI to the spell engine.  However
the libs in this directory depend on the spell engine source code to
be built.

Therefore the libs for this directory are delivered built, and the
source code is included for your reference.
