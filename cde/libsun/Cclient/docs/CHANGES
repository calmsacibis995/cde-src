++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ Release notes

The new c-client release, version 0.14 is now available:

The following bugs are fixed in solaris.c:

	1) Header parse core faulted if the header was larger than 65536.
	   There is now no limit on this beyond VM availability.

	2) The mailbox.lock now has max lifetime of 5 minutes. At that time,
	the c-client attempts to remove it. IF IT FAILS, then the mailbox
	DURING OPEN ONLY it is opened read/only, and the following errmsg 
	#168 is sent:

	168 Mailbox %s.lock CANNOT BE FREMOVED! Please contact an administrator.

	This will be the case if it is owned by root and protected ----------.
	ie, mail.local crashed during delivery.
	Old imapd locks can always be removed.

The following changes have been made to solaris.c:

	You can now SET_LOCKTIMEOUT using the mail_parameter call. The default
	lock timeout is 1 minute. BUT DURING OPEN IT IS SET TO 5 mins and 1 sec.

	For check, etc  ... it is again 1 minute, but the LIFETIME of the lock			IS
ALWAYS 5 min.

	Thus, a check will fail in a minute and you will get error message

	102 Cannot lock mailbox

	When the age finally reaches its lifetime, then the error 168 will
	be sent if the lock is still there and cannot be removed.

This above change is important so as not to hang the UI during checks. This
can be extremely irritating.

The following fix has been made to imapd.c, ie, we have an error number here.

       * OK [READ-ONLY] 128 Now READ-ONLY, mailbox lock surrendered

The following fix has been made to dummy.c:

	The hidden files are no longer listed unless they are explicitly asked
	for, eg,

	list "~/folders/" ".%"

This has been a long standing request by me to me too (:

I think that about covers it for c-client. There is also a fix in log_sv5.c
which enables logging in under NIS+.

Enjoy (:

PS. There is an "#ifdef CLIENTBUILD" to conditionally compile some
optimizations required for NFS that are not needed by the server, and whose
benefits are marginal but measureable (:
