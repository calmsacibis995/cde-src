<H2>MCM Technical Backgrounder:<BR>Solaris Mail Client Interoperability</H2>
<P>
What potential issues arise from the interoperability of <I>Roam</I> with existing
Sun MUAs such as <I>OW Mailtool</I> and <I>Dtmail</I>?  What solutions exist? 
<P>
This document helps answer those questions.
Written by developers of the
different MUAs (<I>Roam</I>, <I>Dtmail</I>, <I>OW Mailtool</I>), we intend this document to be
helpful to Sun employees, especially those in the IR and ENS departments 
who may be faced with similar questions.

<H2>The Solaris Mail Clients</H2>
<P>
First an overview of the different programs.
<P>
<H3>Roam</H3>
<P>
<I>Roam</I> is an IMAP client based on the IMAP protocol.
In the IMAP model, the 
mail resides in a remote server (aka "mail server").  The IMAP daemon,
<I>imapd</I>,
runs on the remote server containing the mail file.
Users run <I>Roam</I> on their
desktops, irrespective of how distant they are from the mail server (home,
hotel, office desktop).  The client connects to the mail server indicated
in the setup/preferences and thereafter, permits full mail management
functionality.  <I>Roam</I> permits users to selectively download messages to
the local machine, disconnect, manage the local messages, and then upload
the changes back to the server.  <I>Roam</I> uses MIME, the latest Internet standard 
for multimedia messages.  <I>Roam</I> also supports Sun Attachment format, Sun's
format for multimedia messages which is obsoleted now.
<P>
<H3>Dtmail</H3>
<P>
<I>Dtmail</I> is an MUA built for the CDE Desktop.  It does not use IMAP and 
operates on the mailfile directly.  It solves a different problem than
<I>Roam</I>: it allows interoperability with the CDE Dekstop programs and runs
using the CDE widget set. <I>Dtmail</I> is expected to use IMAP in the next
version.  <I>Dtmail</I> also uses MIME, and supports Sun Attachment format.
<P>
<H3>OpenWindows Mailtool</H3>
<P>
Mailtool is the MUA originally built for the OW Desktop.  Like <I>Dtmail</I>m, it
operates on the mailfile directly.  Unlike <I>Dtmail</I>, it does not interoperate
with the CDE Desktop.  It supports MIME vaguely, Sun Attachment format
strongly.  It is being obsoleted away.
<P>
<H2>Usage Scenarios</H2>
<P>
Users may be running <I>Roam</I> or <I>Dtmail</I> or <I>OW Mailtool</I>
at any time on one of their folders, normally the /var/mail/<user> INBOX.
They head to another place
(home, office, etc.) and attempt to run an MUA on the same folder.
What can happen?
<P>
Each MUA requires total control over the file they operate on.  This causes
problems when users, operating an MUA on a file at work, go home and run
another MUA on the same file.
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Scenario 1:</B>
User is running <I>Dtmail</I> at work.
They go home and run <I>Roam</I> on the same folder.
<P>
<OL>
<LI><I>Roam</I> takes control of the mailbox file.  
<LI><I>Dtmail</I> will notice that <I>Roam</I> is operating on the folder.  
    Control of the file is totally relinquished by <I>Dtmail</I>.
    <I>Dtmail</I> will pop up a dialog indicating that it is confused -- it 
    expected to have total control over the file.
    Since user is not at work, the dialog will remain up until the
    user comes to work.
    Note that in the meantime,
    the user is free to operate on the mailfile with <I>Roam</I>.
<LI>On coming in to work, the user can click OK in the <I>Dtmail</I> dialog.
    This will exit <I>Dtmail</I>.  
</OL>
<P>
Users can restart <I>Dtmail</I> provided they don't have any other MUA
operating on the same file (e.g., the home <I>Roam</I> session was exited).
If <I>Dtmail</I> notices that there is another MUA monitoring the same file
(e.g., the home <I>Roam</I> session is still alive), it will repeat the 
"I'm confused..." dialog.
<P>
<LI><B>Scenario 2:</B>
Users running <I>Roam</I> at work.  They go home and run <I>Roam</I> on the
same folder.
<P>
No problem.  The home <I>Roam</I> session takes control of the mail file
and underneath the covers.  The work <I>Roam</I> session disconnects from
monitoring the mail file but does not exit.  All changes made by the
home <I>Roam</I> session are saved into the mail file.

<P>
<LI><B>Scenario 3:</B>
Users running <I>Roam</I> at home.
They go to work and run <I>Roam</I> on the same folder.
<P>
No problem.  The work <I>Roam</I> session takes control of the mail file
Underneath the covers, the home <I>Roam</I> session disconnects from
monitoring the mail file but does not exit.  All changes made by the
work <I>Roam</I> session are saved into the mail file.
<P>

<LI><B>Scenario 4:</B>
Users running <I>OW Mailtool</I> at work.
They go home and run <I>Roam</I> on the same folder.
<P>
<I>Mailtool</I> will do one of two possibilities: quit intelligently without
damaging the mailbox OR damage the mailbox and dump core.
</UL>
<P>

<H2>Attachment format confusion</H2>
<P>
As mentioned earlier,
<I>Roam</I> and <I>Dtmail</I> use MIME predominantly whereas
<I>OW Mailtool</I> uses Sun Attachment format predominantly.
If a user knows that he/she will be sending or receiving messages to and from 
<I>OW Mailtool</I> users most of the time,
or always switch between <I>Roam</I> and <I>Mailtool</I>, 
it is suggested they do the following:
<P>
In <I>Roam</I>:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Set the "Keep mime format" property to False.  
This can be achieved via the Properties.. dialog under Mailbox item in 
the menubar.  This will ensure <I>Roam</I> does not translate the messages to 
MIME format automatically, retaining Sun Attachments as they are.
<LI>If the user intends to send out messages with attachments, they
should request <I>Roam</I> to send the attachments with Sun Attachment format.
The default is MIME.
Sun Attachment format can be chosen via the 
<B>Send ... Options</B> menu item or from each Send window where there exists
a toggle button at the top of the window.
</OL>
<P>
<H2>Recommendation</H2>
<P>
It is recommended that if users intend to use <I>Roam</I>,
they should be recommended to use it at work and at home.
This will eliminate mailfile disaster possiblities.
Interoperability of <I>Roam</I> with other mailers, esp <I>OW Mailtool</I>,
always increases the odds of mailfile corruptions.
