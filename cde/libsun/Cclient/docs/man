.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.B imapd
logs various messages and errors to
.BR syslogd ,
with a facility code of 
.BR daemon .
.SS Info Messages

.B "Fatal mailbox error user ="
.I username
.B "mbx ="
.I mbox
.B "host ="
.I "client hostname"
.br
An error occured which caused the server to stop processing
the messages in the mailbox 
.IR mbox .
The connection is closed.
.IP 
If successive attempts to open 
.I mbox
fail, then the mailbox needs to be carefully examined by
an appropriate administrator.  
.B imapd
refuses to open mailboxes that appear to be corrupted.
.HP 12
.B "Logout user ="
.I username
.B "host ="
.I "client hostname"
.br

.I username
has quit the current IMAP session.
.HP 12

.IR mbox .
.HP 12
.B "Autologout user ="

.IR username .
The timer's default is set to 30 minutes.
.HP 12
.B "Connection broken while reading line user ="
.I username
.B "host ="
.I "client hostname"
.br
A network read error has occurred.  The connection is closed.
.HP 12
.B "Retrying after disk error user ="

.B "mbx =" 
.IR mbox :
.I error
.br
A fatal system error has occurred.  This could indicate that the
system is out of virtual memory, or that a server bug has been
detected.
.SS Critical Message
.B imapd
logs the following critical message to
.BR syslogd :
.HP 12
.B "IMAPD SECURITY PROBLEM: lockfile"
.I filename
.B "is a symbolic link"
.br
An attempt to modify an IMAP server session lock has occurred.
This happens when the server session lock is soft linked to
another file.  When this is detected, the 
server attempts to correct the problem by removing the illegal
file.  The associated mailbox cannot be opened until the file
is removed.
.SH DEBUGGING
This section provides server status information and problem work-arounds.
.SS Testing the Server
You can test whether a host has a working IMAP server by 
entering:
.IP
.B "example% telnet hostname 143"
.P
You should see a message similar to the following:
.P
.B "* OK mailserver IMAP4 Service 8.1(sun.11) at Wed, 5 Jun 1996 15:17:50 -0700 (PDT)"
.P
The following error message indicates that the host does not have
the IMAP server running:
.IP
.B "telnet: connect: Connection refused"
.P
To disconnect from the server, enter:
.IP
.B "example% 0 logout"
.SS Update Lock Files
An update lock file appears in the same directory as mailbox, usually:
.IP
.BI /var/mail/ user .lock
.P
If the system crashes while the mailbox is being updated, a stale
.IR user .lock
file may be created.  When the system comes back up and encounters
a stale
.IR user .lock
file, it will automatically attempt to delete it.
If the update lock file cannot be removed 
(write permission is not granted to the user), 
it must be removed by the administrator.
.SS Session Lock Files
For session locking, the IMAP server creates a file in the
.B /tmp
directory of the form:
.IP
.BI /tmp/.imap_ device.inode
.P
The 
.IR device and 
.I inode 
fields are the respective values for the 
mailbox file being session locked.  The 
.I inode 
field is displayed in hexadecimal form.  
.P
A stale session lock file can be created during a system crash
or a core dump.  The server will attempt to remove the session
lock file.  If it cannot be removed by the server, the user will
be denied mailbox access.  The session lock file must then be 
removed manually.
.P
To do this, first locate the correct session lock file
in the 
.B /tmp 
directory that is associated with the mailbox.  Execute:
.IP
.BI "example% ls -i /var/mail/" user
.P
.I user 
is the name of the mailbox.  This returns the inode number
in decimal form.  Convert the inode number into hexadecimal form
and locate its session lock file.
