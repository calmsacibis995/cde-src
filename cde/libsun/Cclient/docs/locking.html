<H2>MCM Technical Backgrounder:<BR>Locking Berkeley Mailbox Files</H2>
<P>
This paper explains the locking mechanisms used on Berkeley
<I>Cap Mail</I>-style mailbox files.
This information is of greatest value to administrators and users who
use several different mail clients on the same server,
for example, <I>Mailtool</I> in the office and <I>Roam</I> at home.

The details of how Sun's mail clients perform locking were taken

<H2>Locking Basics</H2>
<P>
Two layers of locking are applied to Berkeley mailbox files.
The first, called an <I>update lock</I> or <I>short term lock</I>, is used
to guaranty exclusive access to the mailbox file while it is being written,
or to guaranty that the mailbox does not change while it is being read.
The lock is held only for the time needed to read or write the mailbox file,
usually a fraction of a second.
The second layer lock, called a <I>session lock</I> or <I>long term lock</I>,
is used to ensure that only one mail client at a time has general write
access to the mailbox.
Other clients may read the mailbox (usually) or append new messages,
but only the holder of the session lock may modify or delete existing messages.
It is held for as long as the mail client has the mailbox open,
which can mean days or weeks for a user's ``inbox.''
<P>
The update lock is the most important, as it prevents the corruption that
will occur if two clients try to modify the mailbox at the same time,
or if one is reading while another is modying the file.
All mail clients implement the update lock,
and for many mail clients it is the only lock that they use.

<P>
The session lock is arguably a matter of user friendliness,
ensuring graceful behavior if the user invokes two mail clients on the
same mailbox at the same time.
The exact meaning of ``graceful'' varies tremendously among client
implementations,
but is broadly understood to mean that the changes and updates performed by
one mail client will not interact in unexpected ways with another.
Networked workstations and nomadic computers greatly
increase the chance of a user invoking two clients at once;
hence session locking is more important now than
it was in the era of timesharing terminals.

<P>
<H3>Mailbox Operations and Locking</H3>
<P>
There are three general kinds of operations that a client can perform
on a Berkeley mailbox:

<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Append messages.</B>
The client applies the update lock to the mailbox,
appends the message or messages, and then releases the lock.
The existing contents of the mailbox are not changed,
hence no session lock is used.
<P>

<LI><B>Read.</B>
The original way to read a mailbox
(from Version 7 UNIX) was to apply the update lock,
make a complete copy of the mailbox, release the lock,
and then read and make modifications to the copy.
Session locking did not exist.
This mechanism has a number of problems,
not the least of which is scalability.
<P>
Modern mail clients use a combination strategies that allow them to
safely read a mailbox directly.
These include session locking (to prevent other clients from changing
the mailbox while it is open),
caching of parts of the mailbox,
and detection and semaphoring mechanisms that note when other clients have
modified the mailbox (or would like to modify it).
<P>

<LI><B>Modify.</B>
To change the existing contents of a mailbox (which can range
from simply updating header fields to deleting all the messages),
the client must obtain and hold the session lock for the mailbox file,
and then obtain the update lock.
The update lock is released as soon as the update of the file is complete;
the session lock remains as long as the client has the mailbox open.
</UL>
<P>

These basic operations apply to both the user's ``inbox''
(<TT>/var/mail/<I>user</I></TT>) and to private mailboxes (folders)
that follow the Berkeley mailbox format.
Note, however, that while any mail client can append to a private mailbox
("foldering" a message),
only the system mail client <I>/bin/mail</I> (or <I>mail.local</I>) can
append to the ``inbox''.

<P>
<H3>Things That Go Bump In the Mailbox</H3>
<P>

When everyone uses the same mail client all the time <I>and</I> no
clients are trying to read the mailbox file via NFS,
locking behaves as expected.
But when different mail clients or NFS access are involved, things
can go awry:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Different UNIX operating system versions specify different update lock
    methods.
    Mail clients targeted to different UNIX versions -- for example, 4.3BSD vs.
    <I>Solaris</I> -- will ignore each other's locks.
    The effect of this is as if there was no locking at all.
    Usually this will occur only when users obtain and compile their own
    copies of freeware mail clients.
    <P>

<LI>Nearly every mail client implements session locking in a different way,
    even clients from the same vendor on the same operating system.
    Older clients that follow the UNIX Version 7 behavior (descibed above)
    have no session locking at all.
    When using two or more different mail clients, session locking must
    be considered effectively non-existant.
    <P>

<LI>Some mail clients, in particular <I>Mailtool</I> and <I>Dtmail</I>,
    are quite naïve in their reliance on session locking.
    If another client fails to respect their session lock and changes the
    mailbox,
    these clients fail catastrophically.
    It the worst case of <I>Dtmail</I>, it dumps core.
    In the worst case of <I>Mailtool</I>, it corrupts the mailbox file
    and <I>then</I> dumps core.
    <P>

<LI>The session locking of some clients is known to interfere with the
    update locking of others.
    The most common symptom of this is that one or both of the clients hang.
    Killing one allows the other to run normally.
    Usually this class of problems does not cause damage to the mailbox.
    <P>

<LI>Many of the locking mechanisms -- update and session -- do not work
    when the mailbox is mounted on a remote file system, particularly NFS.
    This usually has the effect of having no locking at all.
</UL>

<P>
The remainder of this document will detail the various locking methods used,
describe how locking is done by many common clients,
and recommend strategies for dealing with problems.
<P>

<H2>Update Locking</H2>
<P>
The purpose of the update lock is to prevent two mail clients from
modifying a mailbox file simultaneously.
When locking fails,
the most common effect is for one or more messages to disappear.
If the mailbox is the user's ``inbox,'' this can go unnoticed for some time,
or be blamed to the transport (e.g., <I>Sendmail</I>).
Other effects include messages being inserted into other messages,
messages interleaved with each other,
and the mailbox being truncated in the middle of a message.
<P>
Locking a file is problematic in UNIX
since file locking is a relatively recent addition to the O.S.,
and many implementations are incomplete.
Hence different methods are used in different UNIX flavors.
The three most common methods used to implement update locking are
the creation of a <B>lock file</B> (which is the method used by <I>Solaris</I>),
the <B>flock() system call</B>,
and the <B>lockf() system call</B>.
Each is described in detail below.
<P>
These methods do not interoperate, and in most implemetations
they are <I>voluntary</I>.
This means that if two mail clients use different update locking
methods, the effect will be as if there was no locking at all.
Fortunately,
about the only way for this to happen is for a user to obtain and compile
his own ``freeware'' mail clients and configure them incorrectly.
Mail clients provided by commercial vendors use the update locking
method that is correct for the operating system.
<P>
Incompatability <I>can</I> arise when the mailbox is on a remotely mounted
file system.
Here you have the possibility for, say, a <I>Solaris</I> system and an
<I>HP-UX</I> system to open the same mailbox via NFS.

<H3>The Lock File Method</H3>

Lock file creation is the original update locking method
from Version 7 UNIX.
Despite a lack of elegance and number of obvious weaknesses,
it has proven itself to be the most reliable of all mechanisms.
It is used in <I>Solaris</I>, all Berkeley releases except 4.3BSD,
and by all System V releases except Release 3.2.
The basic idea is to create a file <B><I>mailboxname</I>.lock</B> in the
same directory as the mailbox.
If the file does not exist, it is created;
the client now has exclusive access to the mailbox file.
When the client is finished with the mailbox,
it deletes the lock file,
thereby allowing access to other clients.
If the lock file already exists,
it means that another mail client is busy updating the mailbox.
The new client can wait a few seconds, then try again.
<P>
The creation of the lock file must be done atomically,
that is, a single indivisible system call must be used
to test for the existance of the lock file
and then create it if it does not exist.
Recent UNIX flavors have the flag <TT>O_EXCL</TT> on the
<I>open</I>(2) system call to achieve this.
But because of portability concerns,
most implementations use the following idiom from Version 7 UNIX:
the client creates a temporary file,
and then attempts to link the temporary file to <B><I>mailboxname</I>.lock</B>.
The link succeeds only if the lock file does not exist.
The temporary file is then unlinked.
This is the technique implemented by <I>Solaris</I> <B>libmail.a</I>
library, and used by all SunSoft mail clients.

<P>
The lock file method has the extremely useful characteristic that,
of the three common update lock methods,
it is the only method that works reliably on remote mounted file systems.
Its biggest weakness is that if the mail client faults while the lock is
in effect, a ``stale'' lock file remains.
<P>
Several mechanisms are used to combat this problem.
The most important is a timeout on lock file retries that are attempted
by a client.
If a client finds that a lock file already exists, and it is has been a
``long time'' since it was created (typically more than 5 minutes),
then the client assumes that the process that created the lock file has died,
and it deletes the stale lock file.
<P>
<I>Solaris</I> implementations use the <I>lockf</I> system call to place
an exclusive lock on the lock file.
This allows a new client to determine reliably that another process is still
holding the lock.
This corrects a problem that can occur if <I>two</I> clients are waiting to
obtain the lock,
and both decide simultaneously that the original holder has died. 
<P>
In a few implementations (not <I>Solaris</I>), the client writes its
process ID of into the lock file as an ASCII decimal number.
This allows a new client to test whether the process holding the lock is
still alive.
<P>
There is one notable interoperability problem with the lock file method:
the name of the lock file varies on different operating systems.
For example, System V Release 2 puts the lock file in a subdirectory of
the one containing the mailbox.

<H3>The <I>flock</I> System Call Method</H2>
<P>
4.3BSD mail clients use the Berkeley <I>flock</I>(2) system call to directly
lock the mailbox.
This method has the advantage that the lock is automatically released if
the client faults (dumps core) while holding the lock.
It has the serious disadvantage that is does not work across any known
network file system.
<P>
Later Berkeley releases have reverted to the lock file method described
above.

<H3>The <I>lockf</I> System Call Method</H3>
<P>
Clients for UNIX System V Release 3.2 and its derivitives
(including Hewlett-Packard <I>HP-UX</I>, IBM <I>AIX</I>,
and Sequent <I>Dynix</I>)
use the <I>lockf</I>(2) system call to directly lock the mailbox.
(Some clients use the semantically equivalent options to the
<I>fcntl</I>(2) system call.)
This method has the advantage that the lock is automatically released if
the client faults (dumps core) while holding the lock.
The <I>lockf</I> call also has the potential to make the lock mandatory,
so that even clients that use a different (incorrect) mechanism will be
denied access to the mailbox.
Not all vendors take advantage of this capability, however.
<P>
The <I>lockf</I> call is specified to operate correctly across NFS remote
mounted file systems.
In practice, many vendors have not implemented NFS locking, or have
not implemented it correctly.
(Even the <I>Solaris</I> implementation has conditions that are known to
cause a mail client to hang indefinitely.)
The <I>lockf</I> call does not work at all across many other remote file
systems, including the Andrew File System and Microsoft SMB (LAN Manager).
<P>
It is critical to remember that clients that are ported to multiple
operating systems use the operating system's native locking mechanism.
For example, the CDE <I>Dtmail</I> client is available on <I>Solaris</I>,
<I>HP-UX</I>, and <I>AIX</I>.
But the <I>Solaris</I> <I>Dtmail</I> uses the lock file method,
while the <I>HP-UX</I> and <I>AIX</I> <I>Dtmail</I> use the <I>lockf</I>
method.

<H3>Using Multiple Update Lock Methods</H3>

Some freeware mail clients, for example <I>MH</I>, attempt to improve
the reliability of locking by using several methods simultaneously.
For example, the standard <I>MH</I> configuration for <I>Solaris</I>
uses both the lock file and the <I>lockf</I> system call.
The problem with this is that other clients, including CDE <I>Dtmail</I>,
use the <I>lockf</I> system call to implement session locking.
This causes <I>MH</I> to lock up until the <I>Dtmail</I> session exits.
Users might consider this desirable or undesirable,
depending on how they typically use <I>MH</I>.


<H2>Session Locking</H2>

<P>
Session Locking is used to prevent multiple mail clients from having general
write access to the same mailbox concurrently.
The session lock is held as long
as the client has the mailbox open for Read or Modify;
the session lock is not applied when simply appending to the mailbox.
The holder of a session lock generally expects that the mailbox
will not decrease in size (that is, messages will not be deleted),
and that existing messages will not be changed.
To actually read or modify the mailbox,
the holder of the session lock still must obtain the update lock.
<P>
As noted, the key problem with session locking is that almost every client
implements a different method.
When session locking fails,
as it almost always does between different clients,
the effects fall into three broad catagories:
<P>

<UL>
<LI>Clients that make a private copy of the mailbox while reading it
    (like the Berkeley <I>Cap Mail</I> or System V <I>mailx</I>) generally
    lose changes that were made.
    Most commonly, messages that were deleted by one of the concurrently
    running clients reappear when the last client updates the mailbox.
    Rarely, a fragment of a message will reappear, possibly corrupting the
    mailbox.<P>
<LI>Clients that blatantly assume that session locking works tend to die
    horribly when another client modifies the mailbox from underneath them.
    If they attempt to update the mailbox, it is usually badly corrupted.
    The most notable example is <I>OW Mailtool</I>.<P>
<LI>Clients that maintain a cache or index of the mailbox
    notice when another client modifies the mailbox,
    and attempt to resolve the differences.
    Often they are forced to discard pending modifications and just reread
    the mailbox.
    Good examples include
    <A HREF="/mcm/vendor/hal/ishmail.html">HalSoft <I>Ishmail</I></A>
    or the University of Washington IMAP Server.
    CDE <I>Dtmail</I> attempts to work in this way,
    but occasionally gets confused and dumps core.
</UL>
<P>

Different clients also interpret the exact usage of the session lock
differently.
For example, the <I>Solaris</I> version of <I>mailx</I> restricts all
clients after the first to ``read only'' mode.
<I>Mailtool</I> and <I>Dtmail</I> lock out all clients after the first;
they aren't even allowed read access.
IMAP clients, <I>Roam</I> for example, do exactly the opposite,
handing off control to the most recently invoked client.

<P>
<H2>Per-Client Locking Details</H2>
<P>
The remainder of this document describes how a specific mailbox
clients perform locking.
The mechanisms used for session locking are detailed,
and interoperability problems are noted.
<P>

<H3>Sendmail</H3>
<P>
<I>Sendmail</I> does not formally write messages to mailbox files.
When performing local delivery, it invokes the <I>/bin/mail</I>
or <I>/usr/lib/mail.local</I> (Solaris 2.5) utility, which functions as
described below.
<P>
<I>Sendmail</I> can be configured to append directly to a file,
by specifying a pathname as the recipient in an alias or <TT>.forward</TT>
file.
This mechanism must never be used for mailbox files,
since <I>Sendmail</I> does no locking of the destination file.
<P>


<H3><I>/bin/mail</I> and <I>mail.local</I></H3>
<P>
The <I>/bin/mail</I> utility dates from UNIX Version 7, and has changed
little since that time.
It was originally used for delivery, retrieval, and composition.
Since the introduction of the <I>Cap Mail</I> utility in UNIX 4BSD,
<I>/bin/mail</I> has been almost entirely relagated to the sole
task of appending new mail to a users inbox at the behest of the
mail router <I>Sendmail</I>.
In <I>Solaris</I> 2.5, <I>/bin/mail</I> is finally eliminated, and replaced
by <I>mail.local</I>, a utility that explicitly does only new mail delivery.
<P>
<I>/bin/mail</I> uses locking only on the user's "inbox," which is normally
located at <TT>/var/mail/<I>user</I></TT>.

When appending new messages to the inbox, <I>/bin/mail</I> applies the
update lock, opens the file in append mode, and writes the new message. 
It then releases the update lock.
<P>
When reading the "inbox," <I>/bin/mail</I> applies the update lock,
opens the "inbox" file, and copies the entire "inbox" to another file.
It then closes the "inbox" and releases the update lock.
All subsequent read, delete, and save operations made by the user
are performed on the copy.
When the user exits, <I>/bin/mail</I> applies the update lock,
appends any new messages in the "inbox" to the copy, and then replaces the
original "inbox" file with the (possibly modified) copy.
<P>
Note the lack of session locking.
When multiple clients are running simultaneously, each client will write back
its own impression of the inbox when it exits.
<P>

<P><B><I>The remainder of this document is....</I></B><BR>
<IMG SRC="/graphics/undercon.gif"><BR>

applies the appropriate update lock immediately
upon startup, and makes a private copy of the mailbox.
<P>
<P>
The Berkeley <I>Cap Mail</I> client and its poor stepchild, <I>mailx</I>,
follow the original UNIX Version 7 locking model.
<P>
Only locks things in /var/mail.  No locking outside that dir.
<P>
<I>Solaris</I> introduces two variations.
First,
uses fcntl(fd, F_SETLKW, F_RDLCK or F_WRLCK), which blocks
until the lock is released.  However, since mailx makes a temporary
copy of the folder, this lock is in use only as long as the
copy of the file is being made.
<P>
In addition, the file $HOME/.Maillock is made whenever any
the spool file is opened.  This is used as a per-user semaphore
allowing only one folder per user to be locked (but it doesn't
help when two different users are editing the same folder.
<P>
<H3>OpenLook Version 3 <I>Mailtool</I></H3>
<P>
mailtool (uses mmap for reading file, so it really is reading for
the entire session...):
<P>
Tries to create ${mailfilename}.lock; if that works then
the lock is owned.
<P>
If the create fails then loop, trying to relock every
5 seconds.  If the lock file is over 5 minutes old then
ignore it.
<P>
--Session
<P>
OpenWindows mailtool uses one of two types of methods for
establishing a long term lock: tooltalk or lockf. If
tooltalk locking is enabled, it uses tooltalk. If tooltalk
locking is not enabled, it uses lockf only if the mailbox
is mounted on a local file system. If the mailbox is not
mounted on a local file system, NO LONG TERM LOCKING IS USED.
<P>
Mailtool, using tooltalk, applied to all folders:
<P>
Tooltalk locking within mailtool is disabled by default. The
.mailrc variable 'ttlock' must be set for tooltalk locking
to be used. If the variable is not set, lockf locking is
used.
<P>
send a tooltalk REQUEST, file scoped to the mail folder,
with an message operation of "tlock".
<P>
If it is "handled" (that is, if there is someone listening for
that message), then the file assumed to be currently being
used by another process.  If there was no handler, then the
file is unused.
<P>
If unused, register a pattern on the file (so we will be able
to see requests from other processes).
<P>
If the file is locked, optionally send a tooltalk NOTICE,
file scoped to the mail folder, with a message operation of
"rulock".  Sleep 5 seconds, and retry the lock.
<P>
When using tooltalk as a locking mechanism, there is a
procedure whereby one process can ask another process that
is holding a long term lock to "release" the lock.
<P>
<H3>Mailtool, using <I>lockf</I> (no tooltalk)</H3>
<P>
Mailtool will use lockf() to lock the mailbox only if the
mailbox is on a locally mounted file system. This is due to
problems with the lockf() protocol and the lockd() network
lock daemon which can result in indefinite hangs. The work
around, regrettably, is to do no locking at all on mailboxes
residing on network file system when tooltalk locking is not
available.
<P>
use lockf(fd, F_TLOCK,...) to lock the mail folder.  If
currently locked, use fcntl(fd, F_GETLK,...) to get the pid of
the process (if the locking process is local to the machine).
Optionally send that process a SIGUSR1 signal, which will
cause a mailtool process to do a "done" action.
<P>
<H3>CDE <I>Dtmail</I></H3>
<P>
The CDE <I>Dtmail</I> client works identical to <I>Mailtool</I>,
except that update locking varies based on the native locking
<P>
Dtmail, overview
<P>
Similar to mailtool but complicated because of differences
in partners (HP and IBM) implementations. It does mmap()
mailboxes for the purposes of reading, which means the
mailbox is "read" for the entire time Dtmail has a long
lock on the mailbox. 

Dtmail, Overview
<P>
Dtmail uses a similar scheme to that of OpenWindows
mailtool.  This is complicated somewhat in that the CDE
partners (HP and IBM) have changed the locking machinery
used by sendmail, and thus locking is done differently on
those systems.
<P>
On all systems, Dtmail will first attempt to perform
tooltalk locking to establish a long term lock. This
behavior is enabled by default. If it is disabled <<how??>>
then lockf() locking is performed on Solaris systems only.
<P>
If the mailbox is not mounted on a local file system (on
Solaris systems) or the system is either HP or IBM, NO LONG
TERM LOCKING IS USED if tooltalk locking is disabled.
<P>
Dtmail, using tooltalk:
<P>
Tooltalk locking within Dtmail is enabled by default. The
.mailrc variable 'cdenotooltalklock' must be set for tooltalk
locking to be disabled.
<P>
Dtmail uses standard Desktop Messaging Set to perform file
locking. Dtmail will first express interest in a particular
file by calling ttdt_file_join() and then try to determine
whether other user mail agent is using this file by calling
ttdt_Get_Modified(). If this file is available, Dtmail will
complete the locking process by sending out a TTDT_MODIFIED
event. Otherwise, if the file is being used by another user
mail agent, Dtmail will send out a TTDT_SAVE event to request
the other process to save changes and release the lock.
<P>
After Dtmail has done with the file, it will release the lock
by calling ttdt_file_quit() to unregister interest in the file.
<P>
In order to be backward compatible with OpenWindow's mailtool,
Dtmail also sends out messages using mailtool's protocol.
Those messages are identical to mailtool's own execept that
they contain an extra user argument so Dtmail can determine
the message's origin.
<P>
Dtmail, using lockf()
<P>
Identical to mailtool, in that lockf(F_LOCK) is used to
lock the mailbox. If this fails (the lock is held by another
process), the lock is denied and Dtmail refuses to access
the mailbox.


<H3>IMAP c-client ``Bezerk'' Driver</H3>
<P>
Uses mailbox.lock protocol, waiting for 5 minutes.  The
algorithm is subtly different (it looks at link counts (!)
to see if the lock succeeds, with some comments about NFS
brain damage causing these crimes.
<P>
Roam, berkeley driver (I didn't see the solaris one):
<P>
Uses flock(fd, LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB) to lock the mailbox.
If this exclusive lock cannot be gotten, read the existing lock file
for the pid of the "holding" process (which is assumed to be
on the same machine).  Send this process a SIGUSR2.  Then
try and get the flock() to work once a second for 15 more
seconds.
<P>
The lock is held while the mailbox is open.
<P>
If imapd receives a SIGUSR2, and the stream's driver (only
one stream supported? Its a global) is "bezerk", "mbox", or
"mmdf", the stream is turned into readonly (what happens
to pending changes?)
