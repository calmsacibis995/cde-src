o  Is the c-client compatible with RFC1341, RFC1521 or both?

Supposedly both.

o  How will the proposed new flags mechanism for dealing with CRLF work?

TBD.

o  Where is the latest roam source.

/net/roam/ws1/roam.dynamic/roam.dev/src-imap4

o  Where is the interpretation of Status and X-Status defined?

Status is used by `mail' and `mailx' - it uses "R" and "O" for "Read" and
"Old".

X-Status is a c-client addition.

o  After translating V3 to MIME:

   If we're saving the MIME translation to disk, we nuke the
   X-Sun-Attachment and set mime_tr to NIL.

   If we're not saving the MIME translation to disk, we keep the old
   X-Sun-Attachment and store the MIME translation in mime_tr.  Why do we
   need to keep this translation around?

   The comments just say /* Pour Martin: 10-oct-94 */, but not why?

The IMAP protocol only talks MIME - the MIME translation is kept so we have
the MIME information available to transmit over the wire.

o  What does it mean for a stream to be "silent"?

When a stream is in a "silent" state, it doesn't receive (certain) replies.
This is for "half-open" streams, such as when listing mailboxes.

o  But what's the difference between "halfopen" and "silent" streams?  When
   should a stream by in each state?

A stream is "halfopen" for simple commands, eg. LIST .  The stream is "half"
opened, a connection is made to the imap server, the simple command is sent,
and then the stream is closed.

When a stream is "silent", then any untagged EXISTS or EXPUNGE replies will
be ignored.  This is done at times when it is necessary for the cache to
remain consistent for a while.

o  In the `mtest' program, I get some garbage protocol when disconnecting:

MTest>8
A00006 STATUS INBOX (UID-VALIDITY CHECKSUM)
* 243 EXISTS
* STATUS /var/mail/jsc (MESSAGES 243 UNSEEN 125 UID-NEXT 260 UID-VALIDITY 820698472 CHECKSUM 10154913943)

This is a c-client bug - fixed in the latest c-client.

o In imap_disconnect, why is the imap_uid called without storing its return
  value? :

    if (stream->nmsgs > 0)
      imap_uid (stream,stream->nmsgs);

This information is returned in as an untagged reply.

o mail_checkpoint seems similar to mail_disconnect, except that it pulls
  data over from the server and stores it in the cache.  This function
  doesn't seem to be used in roam or mtest.  When might we need to use it?

  I notice stream->checkpointed is set to T in both imap_disconnect and
  imap_checkpoint.

o The record_subdir is file static - this seems to imply only one mailbox
  may be in record-mode at once.  We may need to fix this for
  mailbox-per-thread capabilities.

static char *record_subdir = NIL;

o Why does roam call the following function in various places before
  operating on the cache?

  mail_parameters(NIL, SET_SAVECACHEPATH, (void *)ROAMSUBDIR);

I notice that savecachepath is file static - this may need to be fixed for
multi-threaded support, depending on whether a different cache directory is
needed for different folders?


o The following static variables need reworking for the c-client to be
  thread safe:

static DRIVER *maildrivers = NIL;
				/* pointer to alternate gets function */
static mailgets_t mailgets = NIL;
				/* mail cache manipulation function */
static mailcache_t mailcache = mm_cache;
				/* WJY/SunSoft: for stream->userdata on open */
static void *userdata = NIL;
				/* WJY/SunSoft: for saving c-client cache */

  DATAPAGE wrt_buf;
  /* Allocate our write buffer */
  wrt_buf. buf = (unsigned char *)fs_get(PAGESIZE+sizeof(long));

  Why is PAGESIZE defined to 8K when on most Sparcs (except Ultra) use a 4K
  page?

This was fixed in Bill's version to be a parameter and use the stack.
