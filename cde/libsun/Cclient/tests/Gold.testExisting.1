Subject: Forwarded: The Full Moon
	I guess we know where our Austin colleagues will be next week...


American-Statesman, 1/9/93:

When Ku Klux Klan members rally at the Capitol a week from today,
they may see something they will never forget - a mass mooning.


This mind-boggling and completely unusual proposition is the
brainchild of Austin musician Steve Fromholz.  If you want to
moon the Klan, just show up and join in with Fromholz.  You don't
even need a ticket.  No place but Austin.    "I can see the bumper
stickers now - I mooned the Klan, Austin '93," says Fromholz,
who to date has only a half dozen or so friends lined up for the
extravaganza.  But he expects many volunteers will make plans
to attend, once the word gets out.    "I'm certain there are a lot of
people in Austin who would leap at the opportunity to moon the
Klan," Fromholz says.  "There are some in the community who
would worry about losing their place in the community, or
losing their job  But there are some of us who don't have to worry
about that."


Fromholz likes this idea because he sees it as a peaceful way to
show the Klan that it isn't appreciated around these parts.  It
would be nice to completely ignore the Klan, but you know that
won't happen.


Sooooo, instead of getting all worked up and cussing and
blowing your top, drop your britches, pull them up, then walk
off, Fromholz suggests.    "It's a way to say, `We don't need you,
go someplace else to get mooned,'" Fromholz said.  "It's a very
simple way of saying, 'I hold the Klan in total disrespect.'

Just moon them and walk away and go back to work.  Just laugh at
them. Don't shout at them and shoot them the finger."


Fromholz is so serious about this that he called Travis County
Sheriff Terry Keel to ask if a group mooning is legal.  Imagine
calling the Sheriff's office and asking that question.  I'll bet
you would get transferred a bunch, huh?


"I had a nice conversation with Steve about that," Keel said.  He
says a group mooning is legal as long as the participants don't
get too explicit, you might say.  He says the law regarding this
activity does not address "the subject of cheeks."


Keel also said that though he couldn't give the group mooning
his "official blessing or clearance," he thought it was a good
concept. "Steve has the right approach," he said.  "People
counterdemonstrate, which is the wrong way to handle it."


Anyway, it must have been an interesting conversation.


"It's hilarious and he was all excited when he talked to me about
it," Keel recalled.  "What was the word he used?  It was as if a
vision came to him."


"It came to me in a flash of light," said Fromholz, who even has
his outfit picked out for the affair - a pair of jeans over red
long johns.


"You got to believe," he said.  "It's like keeping Tinkerbell
alive. But I can picturalize it, and if I can picturalize it, it
will usually happen."


So what should you do if you want to involve your civic group in
this mass mooning of the Klan?  Simple come around and go for it.

Junior Leaguers, Lions, SOSers, developers - come one, come
all.  Fromholz sees this as a community thing, although I think
there are some of y'all who should stay in the house.  I won't name
any names, though.  I don't need the aggravation.


OK.  So I'll name one.  Radio guy Bob Cole.


"It has great possibilities if the Optimises would come out,
and the VFW and the American Legion, and perhaps the
Legislature," Fromholz said. "They showed their (fannies)
all t he way through this last session."


Fromholz advises anyone taking part to keep their distance
from the Klan members, though.


"Mooning a rally is a lot different than mooning a parade," he
explained.  "The thing is you've got to be careful with a rally.
They're not marching by, so they might kick you in the moon, and
they're notorious moon-kickers."


No matter what you think about this, it sure is unique.


"I don't think anyone's ever mooned the Klan before, at least
not en masse," Fromholz said.  "But it's an idea whose time has
come.  And I think Martin Luther King would approve.  This is
nonviolent protest at its best."


Maybe so.  But I wonder how they'll handle it on CNN?

Hey, I ain't got no job, so what do I have to worry about?  "Place in
the community?"  Come on!


See ya at the Capitol on 1/16/93, britches 'bout your knees.

I'll be the one with the crutches.  <g>
