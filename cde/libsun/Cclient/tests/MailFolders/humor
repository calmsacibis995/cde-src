hi !!!

	got this on the Net . thought i would share it with all of you .

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Life is indeed cruel to men. When they are born their  mothers  get
compliments and flowers, when they get  married  their  brides  get
presents and publicity and  when  they  die  their  wives  get  the
sympathies  and  the  insurance  money. I  sincerely  believe  that
whosoever termed the fair sex as the weaker sex has done an  unfair
thing since the weaker sex is indeed the stronger  sex  because  of
the weakness of the stronger sex for the weaker sex.

The world is full of men who convert this weakness into a  lifelong
bondage, euphemistically called 'marriage'. Alas, they forget  that
as bachelors they were longingly looked upon by the weaker sex as
'a thing of beauty and BOY forever' and they roamed  around  like a
rolling stone that gathers no boss. But  unwittingly,  like  fools,
they rush into a venture where even angels fear to tread. They  are
perhaps too innocent to realise that marriage is the  name  of  the
game where the man loses his bachelor's degree and the  woman  gets
her master's degree.

But different bachelors have different  compulsions  to  walk  into
this  bondage. Sometimes   stealing   a   kiss   leads   to   'life
imprisonment' - a perfect example  of  crime  and  punishment. Some
others walk into this trap after calculating that it is cheaper  to
marry a girl and keep her home than not to marry and take her out.

But those who marry in haste repent in  leisure  also. It  is  true
that marriages are made in heaven but when the couple join hands on
the earth it becomes just another union that defies  management. As
the resonance of the weddding recede into the background the  notes
of discord start appearing and the  'better  half'  starts  looking
like the bitter half. It does not take long for the man  to  wonder
what happened to the girl he married and for  the  girl  to  wonder
what happened to the man she didn't. But  most  often  the  discord
happens on account of the average husband's ambition to be able  to
afford what his wife is spending. As  it  always  happens  in  such
cases, the joint account is never over-drawn by  the  wife,  it  is
always under-deposited by the husband.

Old couples however say that such differences between  husband  and
wife are only spice of conjugal relationships; for, where there  is
no difference there must be  a  vast  degree  of  indifference. The
harmony arising out of love is the essence  that  sustains  marital
happiness. It has certain well defined secrets. To be happy  with a
man you must love him a little and  understand  him  a  lot. To  be
happy with a woman you have to love her a lot and understand  her a
little. Mutual trust and confidence  is  the  other  touchstone  of
marital harmony, as every husband expects himself to be his  wife's
first love while every wife hopes herself to be her husband's  last
romance.

In the ultimate analysis, however, marriage  turns  out  to  be  an
American cafetaria: you  choose  what  you  like  and  pay  for  it
later. What you  pay  and  how  much  you  pay  depends  upon  your
luck. For, it takes quite a bit of luck to make  a  wife  out  of a
woman. Remember! God created Woman after Man, and ever since then
she has been after man.

These are the 10 reasons why Govind got a ticket

10) Vishy had got one recently.
9) He wasn't looking at the STOP sign as he was looking elsewhere.
8) He had to prove that he was a macho after removing his moustache.
7) Somebody wanted him to get one.
6) He wanted to prove that he was willing to contribute to the Palo Alto 
area so that the Whipple road exit is widened.
5) He wanted to make that trip memorable so that he can relate it to his 
kids.  ( picture yourself like Govind saying, " Son, those were the days 
when we were carefree.  We had no worry and we never cared about the COPs or 
the STOP sign.  We were young ... blah blah".
4) Love is blind.
3) He wanted an episode for his next drama.
2) He has too much money.
1) He wanted Moorthy to scold him.

Son:     "Dad, I have to do a special report for school. Can I ask you a
         question?"
Father:  " Sure son. What's the question?"
Son:     "What is Politics?"
Father:  "Well, let's take our home for an example. I am the wage earner,
         so let's call me Capitalism. your mother is the administrator of
         money, so we'll call her Government. We take care of your need,
         let's call you The People. We'll call the Maid The Working Class
         and your brother we can call The Future.
         Do you understand son?
Son:     "I'm not really sure, dad. I'll have to think about it."
 
 
That night awakened by his brother's crying, the boy went to see what was
wrong. Discovering that the baby had seriously soiled his diaper,
the boy went to his parents' room and found his mother sound asleep.
He went to the maid's room, where, peeking through the keyhole,
he saw his father in bed with themaid. The boy's knocking went totally
unheeded by his father and the maid,
So the boy returned to his room and went back to sleep.
 
The next morning he reported to his father.
 
Son:     "Dad, now I think i understand what politics is."
Father:  "Good son! Can you explain it to me in your own words?"
Son:     "Well Dad, while Capitalism is screwing the Working Class,
          Government is sound asleep, the People are being completely
          ignored and the Future is full of shit."

> 
> Subject: Consumer's Reports on Selecting Girlfriend (fwd)
> 
> Well it's been almost 20 years since Consumer's Reports reviewed 
> girlfriends (CR, Aug 1972).  Since then, styles have changed, new 
> features have been introduced, and the market for girlfriends has 
> changed substantially.  So we here at CU decided another report was 
> needed.
> 
> As in a car or a computer, you should ask yourself what you need a 
> girlfriend for before obtaining one.  This will, in large part, 
> dictate the final product which you should consider.  Do you want an 
> intellectual companion?  A baby factory?  A hiking partner?  Or just 
> lots of good, old-fashioned sex?  Identifying your needs is the first, 
> and most important, step in selecting a girl- friend.
> 
> The second question which needs to be addressed is, of course, how 
> much you are able to spend.  This is largely determined by your 
> physical and personal characteristics--if you are good looking, have a 
> commanding personality and a good sense of humor, you will have the 
> resources to obtain a fancy, high-end model.  On the other hand, if 
> you are ugly, smell bad, and wear polyester clothes, your choices are 
> more limited.  Keep your purchasing power in mind when considering 
> your selection.  Although the salesman will tell you that a girlfriend 
> can be financed, CU does not recommend this practice; due to
> inflating expectations, the required monetary outlay will actually 
> *increase* with time.
> 
> Used vs. New?
> -------------
> A question many girlfriend seekers have to address is whether to get a 
> new or a used girlfriend.  The answer to this question will, roughly 
> speaking, be determined by your age, as shown in the following table:
> 
> Your age        Used or New
> --------        -----------
> 1-12 years      (see note A)
> 13-16 years     New
> 17-21 years     Used, but not used up 
> 22-35 years     Used heavily 
> 35-60 years     New (see note B)
> 60+             (see note A)
> 
> Notes:
> A: Seek psychiatric help
> B: Only "new" if income > $100,000/year.  Otherwise, "divorced".
> 
> New girlfriends have the advantage that they have no previous bad 
> experiences to project on you, but the disadvantage that they will 
> rarely be old enough to open their own checking account.  Used 
> girlfriends, on the other hand, may be steady, reliable performers, 
> with the initial problems worked out, but CU advises that you avoid 
> models which have much more than average mileage (2.1 SO's/yr).  Much 
> greater than the average may be an indication that the girlfriend was 
> a professional.
> 
> Accessories
> -----------
> Often the potential girlfriends you see on the lot or in a tavern will 
> be loaded with accessories, as the dealer gets a high markup on such 
> items as large bosom, long legs, green eyes, etc.  Other accessories 
> will only appeal to fringe markets, such as models which come 
> pre-equipped with children, or the ability run 10 miles while chanting 
> sanskrit.  In such cases you should make a list of accessories desired, 
> tolerated, and disliked.  Note that some accessories (such as children) 
> can be added later, while others (such as a large bosom) must be 
> factory installed.
> 
> The Test Ride
> -------------
> When evaluating a girlfriend, a test ride is essential.  The test ride 
> ritual begins with the so-called "pickup line", which can range from 
> the simple if dull ("Can I buy you a drink?") to the aggressively hip 
> ("dance with me or I'll kill you") to the arcane ("You're my Camus 
> comrade, and I want to leap you, Faith!").  CU rates as Not Acceptable 
> "Smile, you'll look better."  Once on the test bed, evaluate handling, 
> stability, and acceleration.  The two questions you want to answer 
> are: how fast, and how far?  Examine the detailing.  Does the bosom 
> sag?  Does the heater warm adequately, or does she remain cool?
> 
> Ordering vs. On-The-Lot
> -----------------------
> Finding the right girlfriend can be a frustrating experience, and many 
> potential customers find it hard to get the exact model and 
> accessories wanted. In such cases ordering from the factory is an 
> option.  Delivery time, however, is from 14 to 16 years (depending on 
> the state you live in), and CU questions the usefulness of such a 
> practice: if you have access to the baby factory, you should 
> reconsider your need for a girlfriend anyway.
> 
> Methodology
> -----------
> Girlfriends were evaluated by a dedicated group of 10 test engineers, 
> selected to typify the average seeking population.  All tests were 
> performed at CU's specially constructed test facility, which included 
> a bedroom, kitchen, and living room, and at a number of bars and 
> taverns surrounding the facility.  A series of seven tests were run, 
> evaluating each product according to the following criterion: 
> intelligence, wit, humor, empathy, initiative, looks, and performance.
> 
> Results
> -------
> Girlfriends are grouped together in categories by similarity.  Within 
> each category, variation is not statistically significant.
> 
> Category        Comments
> --------        ---------------------------------------------------- 
> Goddess         This is the woman of your dreams.  She comes equipped 
> with all the options you want and none of the ones you don't. She can 
> argue subtle points of philosophy, give you a stiff game of 
> racquetball, understand what you mean even if you don't say it, and 
> break a bed.  No mental or physical hang-ups.  The drawback is that 
> this model is not actually available.
> 
> Goddess-in-law  This model is similar to the goddess, but comes with 
> contractual retainers, such as a psychotic ex-husband, a spiteful 
> mother, an alcoholic father, and a bratty kid.  This model tends to 
> generate grey hairs.
> 
> Ms. Right       The best all-around choice for most girlfriend

> possibly in the wrong size or hair color.  Other than that,

> but can occasionally be found with luck.
> 
> Babe            This is the flashy, fully-loaded variety with all the

> Showy, and suitable for a parade or for impressing your friends, but

> 
> Friend          The model with the most empathy.  Caring and kind but 
> you wouldn't be caught dead in it.  Availability is poor to fair, 
> depending on quality.

Subject: APARTMENT RENT .... (fwd)
To: krr@cs.wayne.edu (Krishna Raman)
Mailer: Elm [revision: 70.85]


                              THE APARTMENT

A prosperous businessman propositioned a beautiful chorus girl.  She agreed to
spend the night with him for $500.00.  When he was ready to leave, he told her
he didn't have the money with him, but he would have his secretary write a
cheque and mail it to her, calling it "Rent for Apartment".

On the way to his office the followint morning, he decided that the whole thing
wasn't worth the price he had agreed to pay.  So he had his secretary send a
cheque for $250.00 with the following note:

	Dear Madam:

	Enclosed is a cheque in the amount of $250.00 for the rent
	of your apartment.  I am not sending the amount agreed 
	upon because when I rented the apartment I was under the
	impression that:

		1) It had never been occupied,
		2) That there was plenty of heat, and
		3) That it was small.

	Last night I found it had previously been occupied, that 
	there was no heat, and it was entirely to large.
					
	Very Truly Yours,
	Mr. Prosperous Businessman

Upon receipt of the note, the girl returned the cheque for $250.00 with the
following note:

	Dear Sir:

	I cannot understand how you can expect such a beautiful
	apartment to remain unoccupied.  As to the heat, there is
	plenty...if you know how to turn it on.  As to the size,
	it is not my fault that you did not have enough furniture
	to furnish it properly.

	Very Truly Yours,
	Miss Beautiful Chorus Girl

Subject: Special High Intensity Training

TO:  All Employees
     From: Management
     Subject: Special High Intensity Training

     In order to assure the highest levels of quality work and productivity
     from employees, it will be our policy to keep all employees well
     trained through our program of SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING
     (S.H.I.T.). We are trying to give employees more S.H.I.T. than anyone
     else.

     If you feel that you do not receive your share of S.H.I.T. on the job,
     please see your manager.  You will be immediately placed at the top of
     the S.H.I.T.list, and our managers are especially skilled at seeing
     that you get all the S.H.I.T. you can handle.

     Employees who don't take their S.H.I.T. will be placed in DEPARTMENTAL
     EMPLOYEE EVALUATION PROGRAMS (D.E.E.P S.H.I.T.).  Those who fail to
     take D.E.E.P. S.H.I.T. seriously will have to go to EMPLOYEE ATTITUDE
     TRAINING (E.A.T. S.H.I.T.).  Since our manager took S.H.I.T. before
     they were promoted, they don't have to do S.H.I.T. anymore, and are
     all full of S.H.I.T. already.

     If you are full of S.H.I.T., you may be interested in a job training
     others.  We can add your name to our BASIC UNDERSTANDING LECTURE LIST.
     (B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T.).
     Those who are full of B.U.L.L. S.H.I.T. will get the S.H.I.T.jobs, and
     can apply for promotion to DIRECTOR OF INTENSITY PROGRAMMING (D.I.P.
     S.H.I.T.).

     If you have further questions, please direct them to our HEAD OF
     TRAINING, SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING (H.O.T.S.H.I.T.).

     Thank you,

     BOSS IN GENERAL
     SPECIAL HIGH INTENSITY TRAINING (B.I.G. S.H.I.T.)

And if you write broken code , you will become a member of
Project for Idiot Employee Continue Education of S.H.I.T.
(P.I.E.C.E of S.H.I.T)

just humor.

and
>>as they had not been dating very long, after careful consideration, he
>>decided a pair of gloves would strike the right note: romantic, but not 
too
>>personal.
>>
>>Accompanied by his sweetheart's younger sister, he went to Nordstrom and
>>bought a pair of white gloves.  The sister purchased a pair of panties for

>>During the wrapping, the clerk mixed up the items and the sister got the
>>gloves and the sweetheart got the panties.  Without checking the contents,
>>the young man sealed the package and sent it to his sweetheart with the
>>following note:
>>
>>"I chose these because I noticed that you are not in the habit of wearing
>>any when we go out in the evening.  If it had not been for your sister, I
>>would have chosen the long ones with the buttons, but she wears short ones
>>that are easier to remove.
>>
>>"These are a delicate shade, but the lady I bought them from showed me the
>>pair she had been wearing for the past three weeks and they were hardly
>>soiled.  I had her try yours on for me and she looked really smart.
>>
>>"I wish I was there to put them on for you the first time, as no doubt
other
>>hands will come in contact with them before I have a chance to see you
again.
>>
>>"When you take them off, remember to blow in them before putting them away
as
>>they will naturally be a little damp from wearing.
>>
>>"Just think how many times I will kiss them during the coming year.  I 
hope
>>you will wear them for me on Friday night.  All my love.
>>
>>"P.S.  The latest style is to wear them folded down with a little fur

>>This letter originated at Ricks College in Rexburg, Idaho.  It brings good
>>luck to everyone who passes it on. The one who breaks the chain will have
bad

>>
>>Do not keep this letter.  Do not send money.  Just have your wonderful,
>>efficient computer make five additional copies and send it to five of your
>>friends to whom you wish good luck.  You will see that something good
>>happens to you four days from now if the chain is not broken.

>>This is not a joke.  You will receive good luck in four days.

THE FOLLOWING ARE ACTUAL STATEMENTS FOUND ON INSURANCE FORMS WHERE CAR DRIVERS
ATTEMPTED TO SUMMARIZE THE DETAILS OF AN ACCIDENT IN THE FEWEST POSSIBLE
WORDS. THE INSTANCES OF FAULTY WRITING SERVE TO CONFIRM THAT EVEN INCOMPETENT
WRITING CAN BE HIGHLY ENTERTAINING.

 o Coming home I drove into the wrong house and collided with a tree I
   don't have.

 o The other car collided with mine without giving warning of its intention.

 o I thought my window was down, but I found it was up when I put my head
   through it.

 o I collided with a stationary truck coming the other way.

 o A truck backed through my windshield into my wife's face.

 o The guy was all over the road. I had to swerve a number of times before I
   hit him.

 o I pulled away from the side of the road, glanced at my mother-in-law and
   headed over the embankment.

 o In an attempt to kill a fly I drove into a telephone pole.

 o I had been shopping for plants all day and was on my way home. As I reached
   an intersection a hedge sprang up, obscuring my vision and I did not see
   the other car.

 o I had been driving for forty years when I fell asleep at the wheel and had
   an accident.

 o I was on the way to the doctor with rear end trouble when my universal joint
   gave way causing me to have an accident.

 o As I approached an intersection a sign suddenly appeared in a place where
   no stop sign had ever appeared before. I was unable to stop in time to
   avoid the accident.

 o To avoid hitting the bumper of the car in front I struck a pedestrian.

 o My car was legally parked as it backed into another vehicle.

 o An invisible car came out of nowhere, struck my car and vanished.

 o I told the police that I was not injured, but on removing my hat found that
   I had a fractured skull.

 o I was sure the old fellow would never make it to the other side of the road
   when I struck him.

 o The pedestrian had no idea which way to run as I ran over him.

 o I saw a slow moving, sad faced old gentleman as he bounced off the roof
   of my car.

 o The indirect cause of the accident was a little guy in a small car with
   a big mouth.

 o I was thrown from my car as it left the road. I was later found in a ditch
   by some stray cows.

 o The telephone pole was approaching. I was attempting to swerve out of the
   way when I struck the front end.

Quotables on married life: 
 
 
>    Getting married is very much like going to a continental 
>    restaurant with friends. You order what you want, then when you 
>    see what the other fellow has, you wish you had ordered that. 
> 
>    At the cocktail party, one woman said to another, "Aren't you 
>    wearing your wedding ring on the wrong finger?" The other 
>    replied, "Yes I am, I married the wrong man." 
> 
>    Man is incomplete until he is married. Then he is really 
>    finished. 
> 
>    Marriage is an institution in which a man loses his bachelor's 
>    degree and the woman gets her master's. 
> 
>    A little boy asked his father, "Daddy, how much does it cost to 
>    get married?" And the father replied, "I don't know, son, I'm 
>    still paying for it." 
> 
>    Young Son: Is it true, Dad, I heard that in some parts of 
>    Africa a man doesn't know his wife until he marries her? 
>    Dad: That happens in most countries, son. 
 
>    Then there was a man who said, "I never knew what real 
>    happiness was until I got married; and then it was too late. 
> 
>    A happy marriage is a matter of give and take; the husband 
>    gives and the wife takes. 
> 
>    When a newly married man looks happy we know why. But when a 
>    ten-year married man looks happy - we wonder why. 
> 
>    Married life is very frustrating. In the first year of marriage, 
>    the man speaks and the woman listens. In the second year, 
>    the woman speaks and the man listens. In the third year, they 
>    both speak and the neighbors listen. 
> 
>    After a quarrel, a wife said to her husband, "You know, I was 
>    a fool when I married you." And the husband replied, "Yes, 
>    dear, but I was in love and didn't notice it." 
> 
>    It doesn't matter how often a married man changes his job, he 
>    still ends up with the same boss. 
 
> 
>    A man inserted an 'ad' in the classifieds: "Wife wanted". Next 
>    day he received a hundred letters. They all said the same 
>    thing: "You can have mine." 
 
>    When a man opens the door of his car for his wife, you can be 
>    sure of one thing: either the car is new or the wife. 
> 
>    A perfect wife is one who helps the husband with the dishes. 
> 
>    A woman was telling her friend , "It is I who made my husband a 
>    millionaire."  "And what was he before you married him." Asked 
>    the friend. The woman replied, " A multi-millionaire".

   Two Surds Santa Singh and Banta Singh go to France on a
   pleasure trip. They meet this Frenchman called Jean Paul
   and become good pals. Jean Paul finds these two Surds
   some- what amusing and so he goes all out to make them
   happy. He treats them at pubs, bars, discotheques ......
   This goes on for a while until one fine day Jean Paul
   does not turn up. The Surds assume that some important
   work would have held him up and do not take a serious
   note of it. But, perhaps something was serious as Jean
   Paul does not turn up for next five days at a stretch. At
   this the Surds get alarmed and go to the police station
   to lodge a complaint. The inspector asks them to give
   details of the person who's missing. The following
   conversation follows:

   Santa Singh: Well, his name is Jean Paul.
   Inspector: It's a very common name in France.
   Something more please.

   Banta Singh: Well, he is very tall.
   Inspector: Most of the people in France are tall.
      Big deal.

   Santa singh: Well, he's got blue eyes.
   Inspector: Oh! no. Something more substantial.
   Banta Singh: I got it. This is slightly uncommon.
   I'm sure now you shall be able to
   track him. You see, He's got two holes in his ass.

   Inspector: (shocked): Well, well, that's curious. Are you
   sure?

   Banta Singh: Ya! Ya!

   Inspector: Are you definitely sure that this very
   personal info. you have is CORRECT ?

   Banta Singh: Most certainly.

   Inspector (still skeptical): But how're you so sure ?
   Banta Singh: Simple. Whenever we used to go with him
   to the bar, everyone used to greet him as " Here comes
   Jean Paul with two ass-holes.

         One day in class the teacher brought a bag full of fruit.
     
         "Now class, I'm going to reach into the bag and describe a piece of 
         fruit, and you tell what fruit I'm talking about."
     
         "okay, first  it's round, plumb and red."
     
         Of course, Johnny raised his hand high, but the teacher, wisely, 
         ignored him and picked Deborah, who promptly answered "An apple."
     
         "No Deborah, it's a beet, but I like your thinking.  Now, for the 
         second. It's soft, fuzzy, and colored red and brownish."
     
         Well, Johnny is hopping up and down in his seat trying to get the 
         teacher to call on him.  But she skips him again and calls on Billy.
     
         "Is it a peach?"
     
         "No, Billy, I'm afraid it's a potato.  But I like your thinking. 
         Here's another  it's long, yellow, and fairly hard."
     
         By now, Johnny is about to expolde as he waves his hand frantically. 
         The teacher skips him again and calls on Sally.
     
         "A banana," she says.
     
         "No," the teacher replies, "it's a squash, but I like your thinking."
     
         Jonny is kind of irritated now, so he speaks up loudly.
     
         "Hey, I've got one for you teacher; let me put my hand in my pocket. 
         Okay, I've got it it's round, hard, and it's got a head on it."
     
         "Johnny!"  she cries.  "That's disgusting!"
     
         "Nope," answers Johnny, "it's a quarter, but I like your thinking!"

Hey guys (And Gopi too),

        I thought you might enjoy this tid-bit. I know that not all of you have 
significant others, but it's good preparation, in case you ever have to "shoo" 
away the people around you who must obviously be flocking like flies. (initially
I thought of writing, "...dropping like flies," but I thought that might be a 
bit rude).

                                UV

PS: Jess: This will come in handy in Rio, I'm sure. Write soon.

I just thought you might like the moral of this story too, as I did.

>
>   Two men, both seriously ill, occupied  the same hospital room.
>   One man was allowed to sit up in his bed for an hour each
>   afternoon to help drain the fluid from his lungs. His bed was
>   next to the room's only window.  The other man had to spend all
>   his time flat on his back.  The men talked for hours on end.
>   They spoke of their wives and families, their homes, their
>   jobs, their involvement in the military service, where they had
>   been on vacation.  And every afternoon when the man  in the bed
>   by the window could sit up, he would pass the time by
>   describing to his roommate all the things he could see outside
>   the window.  The man in the other bed began to live for those
>   one-hour periods where his world would be broadened and
>   enlivened by all the activity and color of the outside world.
>
>   The window overlooked a park with a lovely lake, the man said.
>   Ducks and swans played on the water while children sailed their
>   model boats. Lovers walked arm in arm amid flowers of every
>   color of the rainbow.  Grand old trees graced the landscape,
>   and a fine view of the city skyline could  be seen in the
>   distance.  As the man by the window described all this in
>   exquisite detail, the man on the other side of the room would
>   close his  eyes and imagine the picturesque scene.
>
>   One warm afternoon the man by the window described a parade
>   passing by.  Although the other man couldn't hear the band, he
>   could see it in his mind's eye as the gentleman by the window
>   portrayed it with descriptive words.  Unexpectedly, an alien
>   thought entered his head: Why should he have all the pleasure
>   of seeing everything while I never get to see anything ? It
>   didn't seem fair.  As the thought fermented the man felt
>   ashamed at first.  But as the days passed and he missed seeing
>   more sights, his envy eroded into resentment and soon turned
>   him sour.  He began to brood and he found himself unable to
>   sleep.  He should be by that window - that thought now
>   controlled his life.
>
>   Late one night as he lay staring at the ceiling, the man by the
>   window began to cough.  He was choking on the fluid in his
>   lungs.  The other man watched in the dimly lit room as the
>   struggling man by the window groped for the button to call for
>   help.  Listening from across the room he never moved, never
>   pushed his own button which would have brought the nurse
>   running.  In less than five minutes the coughing and choking
>   stopped, along with the sound of breathing.  Now there was
>   only silence ..... deathly silence.
>
>   The following morning the day nurse arrived to bring water for
>   their baths.  When she found the lifeless body of the man by
>   the window, she was saddened and called the hospital
>   attendants to take it away -- no works, no fuss.  As soon
>   as it seemed appropriate, the other man asked if he could be
>   moved next to the window.  The nurse was happy to make the
>   switch, and after making sure he was comfortable, she left him
>   alone.
>
>   Slowly, painfully, he propped himself up on one elbow to take
>   his first look.  Finally, he would have the joy of seeing it
>   all himself.  He strained to slowly turn to look out the
>   window beside the bed.
>
>   It faced a blank wall.
>
>---
>   So the moral of the story is:  the pursuit of happiness is a
>   matter of choice . . . . . it is a positive attitude we
>   consciously choose to express.  It is not a gift that gets
>   delivered to our doorstep each morning, nor does it come
>   through the window.  And I am certain that our circumstances
>   are not the things that make us joyful.  If we wait for them
>   to get just right, we wil never find lasting joy.  The pursuit
>   of happiness is an inward journey.  Our minds are like
>   programs, awaiting for the code that will determine behaviour;
>   like bank vaults awaiting our deposits.  If we regularly
>   deposit positive, encouraging, and uplifting thoughts.  If
>   we continue to bite our lips just before we begin to grumble

>   negative thought as it germinates.  We will find that there

>
>           "Okay, first:  it's round, plumb and red."
>
>           Of course, Johnny raised his hand high, but the teacher,   
>wisely
>           ignored him and picked Deborah, who promptly answered "An   
>apple."
>
>           "No Deborah, it's a beet, but I like your thinking.  Now for

>Billy.
>
>           "Is it a peach?"
>
>           "No, Billy, I'm afraid it's a potato.  But I like your

>
>           By now Johnny is about to explode as he waves his hand

>           he teacher skips him again and calls on Sally.

>           "A banana," she says.
>
>           "No," the teacher replies, "it's a squash, but I like your

>
>           Johnny is kind of irritated now, so he speaks up loudly.
>
>           "Hey, I've got one for you teacher; let me put my hand in my

>           Okay, I've got it:  it's round, hard, and it got a head on

>
>           "Johnny!" she cries.  "That's disgusting!"

These are pretty funny!

 Answering Machine Messages
 
 We're sorry. You have reached an imaginary number. Please rotate your
phone 90 degrees and try
 again.
 
 Hi, this is Ed. I'm secretly replacing Faisal and Bob with dark sparkling
Folger's Crystals. Leave your name, number, and a brief message and they'll
call you back when they're nice and percolated. See if you can tell the
difference.
 
 WE ARE BORG. RESISTANCE IS FUTILE. YOU WILL BE ASSIMILATED. But we're not
home right now. So leave a message at the tone, and we'll assimilate you
 later.

 Hi! John's answering machine is broken. This is his refrigerator. Please
speak very slowly, and I'll
 stick your message to myself with one of these magnets.
 
 Hello, this is Ron's toaster. Ron's new answering machine is in the shop
for repairs, so please leave your message when the toast is done...
(Cachunk!)
 
 Please leave a message. However, you have the right to remain silent.
Everything you say will be recorded and will be used by us.
 
 Hello, this is KVKE, you're on the air.
 (or)
 Hello, you're caller number nine!
 
 (Very fast:) Hi, this is 904-4344. If you want to leave a message, please
wait for the tone. If you want to leave your name and number, please press
pound, press 3, then dial
 your name, then press 6 and dial your number. If you want to leave your
name and just a message, press star, press 6, ask for extension 4443, then
leave your name and message. If you want to leave your number and the
 time you called, please press star twice, spin in a circle, press 1 twice,
talk loud and BEEP
 
 E'llo. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Leave your name and
number, and prepare to die.
 
 This is the Literacy Self Test Hotline. After the tone, leave your name
and number, and recite a sentence using today's vocabulary word. Today's
word is "supercilious".
 
 Greetings, you have reached the Sixth Sense Detective Agency. We know who
you are and what you want, so at the sound of the tone, please hang up.
 
 I can't come to the phone now because alien beings are eating my brain.
Leave a message anyway, and after the alien beings assume my shape, one of
them will get back to you.
 
 I can't come to the phone now because I have amnesia and I feel stupid
talking to people I don't remember. I'd appreciate it if you could help me
out by leaving my name and telling me something about myself. Thanks.
 
 Thank you for calling the CSU Automated Hearing Test Line. Prepare for
Test
 1. Is this tone louder
 in your left ear or right ear? ... BEEP
 
 (Rod Serling imitation:) You're dazed, bewildered, trapped in a world
without time, where sound collides with color and shadows explode. You see
a signpost up ahead -- this
 is no ordinary telephone answering device... You have reached, "The
Twilight Phone".
 
 Thank you for calling 434-2322. If you wish to speak to Tim, push 1 on
your touch tone phone now. If you wish to speak to Lynn, push 2 on your
touch tone phone now. If
 you have a wrong number, push 3 on your touch tone phone now. All of this
button pushing doesn't do anything, but it is a good way to work off anger,
and it makes us feel like we have a big time phone system.
 
 (In a bored voice:) Heaven, God speaking...
 
 Lucifer speaking. Who in hell do you want?
 
 Thank you for calling the Metropolitan Church of the Holy Bible. Today's
commandment is Number 6, Thou shalt not... er... Bear a... er... Shalt not
witness thy... uh...
 Neighbor's, Oh, I mean, false... er... Shalt not commit a bear... Dern...
 
 This is a test. This is a test of the Answering Machine Broadcast System.
This is only a test.
 
 I can't come to the phone now, so if, well, actually, I CAN come to the
phone now, I mean, like, I'm at the phone NOW, recording this message, but
I'm doing this NOW, while you're listening to it LATER, except for you I
guess it's NOW, like, when you're listening to it... I mean, like, wait,
gosh. This is so confusing.
 
 (Recorded directly from AT&T:) We're sorry, but the number you dialed is
disconnected or no longer in service.

your schedule of payment. Remember to speak clearly at the sound of the
tone. Thank you.

>>>>>>>     "So, then, your name is Mangalore Govinda, not Dinesh."

>>>>>>>     "What?  You said her name is Sooneetha."
>>>>>>>     "Yes, that is her name, Suneetha, but we call her Ammanni."
>>>>>>>     "Is that her nick-name?"

>>>>>>>    "OK, what are their names?"
>>>>>>>     "The oldest one, he is my big brother.  He is called GovindaNNa."
>>>>>>>     "Govind Anna?  Then Anna is his last name."

>>>>>>>     "What is his NAME?"

>>>>>>>     "Then your last name is But."
>>>>>>>     "Not but, Bhat, B-H-A-T.  But that's not his name, you see."
>>>>>>>     "If that's not his name, what is it?  Why does he have it
>>>>>>>      in his name?"
>>>>>>>     "Bhat simply means he is a brahmin.  He might as well write
>>>>>>>      Rao, like his father does, or Sharma, like my father's
>>>>>>>      second brother does."
>>>>>>>     "How does he write his name in official papers?"
>>>>>>>     "Nettar Govinda Bhat.  That's how he writes it."
>>>>>>>     "How does his father write it?"
>>>>>>>     "Nettar Venkata Subba Rao."
>>>>>>>     "Aha, I can see now.  Your father is G.K.Nettar, his
>>>>>>>      brother is Nettar something Rao... your last name is then
>>>>>>>      Nettar.  Aha, I got it."
>>>>>>>     "But Nettar is not the last name.  It is the house name."
>>>>>>>     "I don't care.  Tell me one last time, what is YOUR last name?"

Two missionaries in Africa get apprehended by a tribe of 
very hostile cannibals who put them in a large pot of 
water, build a huge fire under  it, and leave them there. 
A few minutes later, one of the missionaries starts
to laugh uncontrollably.  The other missionary can't believe 
it! He says, "Whats wrong with you?  We're being boiled 
alive! They're gonna eat us!  What could possibly be funny
at a time like this?" The other missionary says, "I just peed in the 
soup."
     
------------------------------------------------------------------- 
On reaching his plane seat, a man is surprised to see a parrot 
strapped in next to him.   He asks the stewardess for a coffee where 
upon the parrot squawks, "And get me a whisky you cow."
     
The stewardess, flustered, brings back a whisky for the parrot
and forgets the coffee.  When this omission is pointed out to her, 
the parrot drains its glass and bawls, "And get me another whisky 
you twit."
     
Quite upset, the girl comes back shaking with another whisky
but still no coffee.  Unaccustomed to such slackness, the man tries the 
parrot's approach, "I've asked you twice for a coffee, go and get it 
now or I'll give you a slap."
     
Next moment, both he and the parrot have been wrenched up and 
thrown out of the emergency exit by 2 burly stewards.  Plunging 
downwards, the parrot turns to him and says, "For someone who can't 
fly, you're a lippy bastard..."

It seems a pastor from Maine skipped services one Sunday to go bear 
hunting in the mountains. As he turned the corner along the path, he 
and a bear collided. The pastor stumbled backwards, slipped off the 
trail, and began tumbling down the mountain--with the bear in hot 
pursuit. Finally the pastor crashed into a boulder, sending his 
rifle in one direction and breaking both legs.
     
As the bear closed in, the pastor cried out in desperation, "Lord, 
I'm sorry for what I have done. Please forgive me and save me! Lord, 
please make that bear a Christian."
     
Suddenly the bear skidded to a halt at the pastor's feet, fell to 
its knees, clasped its paws together and said, "God, bless this food 
which I am about to receive."

Plane crashes on a desert island. 15 survivors. 3 Italians, two men 
and a woman, 3 French people, 2 men and a woman, 3 Germans (you
get the picture), 3 Greeks and 3 Brits.
     Six months later....
     
     One Italian man had killed the other and was living with the woman.
     
     The French had a delightful menage a trois.
     
     The Germans had a strict rotation. Hans on odd days, Franz on even.
     
     The Greek men were living together and had the woman doing the house 
     work.
     
     And the Brits....were waiting to be introduced to each other.

       Did you hear about the surd that stayed up all night

saw a sign that  said "DISNEYLAND LEFT". After thinking for
a minute, he said to himself "oh well !" and turned around
and drove home.
On his way home the same surd drove past another sign that said
"CLEAN RESTROOMS 8 MILES". By the time he drove eight miles,
he had cleaned 43 restrooms.

*****************************************************************
One sardarji was appearing for his University final
examination. He takes his seat in the examination hall, stares at
the
question  paper for five minutes, and then in a fit of inspiration
takes his shoes off and throws them out of the window. He then
removes his turban and throws it away as well. His shirt, pant,
socks  and watch follow suit.
The invigilator, alarmed, approaches him and asks what is going
on.
"Oye, I am only following the instructions yaar," he says, " it
says
here, 'Answer the following questions in brief'.".

Weekly Status: May 2 - May 9, 1997
Name: Ibrahim Mustafa

Planned Tasks
-------------
Continue working on dtterm, sdtimage and helpviewer bugs

Completed Tasks
---------------

1. Fixed Bug Id:

   1266197 3 4 dtterm font size not saved properly - Had to rewrite
               a portion ov termview widget to get this to work.

   4050585 1 2 "F10-F12 don't produce escape sequences in dtterm
                as per help documentation - F11, and F12 have the
                names SunF36 and SunF37 respectively on the new
                sun keyboard. F10 was used as the default osf
                motif bindings on the Shell Widget. Thanks for John
                McKernan for his directions on Xt and Xm.
                
   4038849 3 3 No entry for dtterm in termcap - With help from John
               Perry, now dtterm can have its own entry in termcap.

   4051045 2 2 dtterm drops core on startup: x86, s297_33 - Some
               Variable somewhere in dtterm is initialized to 0 on
               the SPARC while it is garbage on the Intel. I thought
               it was a motif but Luo straightened that out.


2. Closed:

   4048993 3 2 dtterm core dumps periodically - Few enhancements to
               dtterm's code that could potentially improve this and
               other intermittent bugs.

   4050504 2 2 sdtimage core dumped - Could not reproduce it myself
               nor the submitter could later. Not much info on it
               to start with.

3. Misc:
        Worked with luo and John McKernan on few bugs against
        dtterm and the IM (htt) - The bugs manifest themselves
        when there is an ApplicationShell Widget involved. More
        to be investigated in this area.


Tasks planned for next week
---------------------------

More helpviewer, sdtimage, and dtterm bugs.

Love, Rollie

National Council of Teachers of English doublespeak awards for 1984.

The State Department won 1st prize for replacing the word killing with  
"unlawful or arbitrary deprivation of life."

Second prize:  George Bush for equating liberals with Nicaraguan leftists.

Third:  Casper Weinberger for the remark he made after the American soldiers
were removed from Lebanon to ships offshore:  "Nothing has changed.  We are
not leaving Lebanon.  The Marines are being deployed two or three miles to
the west."

Runners up:

The National Transportation Safety Board for calling airplane crashes
"controlled flights into terrain" in its investigation records.

The Pentagon for calling peace, "permanent pre-hostility," calling combat,
"violence processing," and for referring to civilian casualties in nuclear
war as "collateral damage."

The Pentagon was also cited for calling the October 1983 invasion of
Grenada a "predawn vertical insertion."
