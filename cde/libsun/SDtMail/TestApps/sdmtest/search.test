I looked at the Xthread about a month ago and reached the
same conclusions. It think that Xthread.h *may* be useful
for making (at a minimal level) a library mt-safe.=20

I do not see how Xthreads could be used in most mt-hot applications.

An odd thing is that in thread create (xthread_fork())
they define a temporary variable to hold the thread-id.
However it is within '{}' and therefore goes out of scope
and can never be used.  In both of these cases, the thread-id
is an optional argument. I have to wonder if the
implementors knew what they were doing.

->POSIX
#define xthread_fork(func,closure) { pthread_t _tmpxthr; \
        pthread_create(&_tmpxthr,pthread_attr_default,func,closure); }

->WIN32
#define xthread_fork(func,closure) { \
    DWORD _tmptid; \
    CreateThread(NULL, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE)func, (LPVOID)closure, =
0, \
                 &_tmptid); \


---
 I think that we should put a halt to its usage or the obviously
  not well thought out interface will become a de faco standard.

Or, if you value performance and run your own DNS server, update your root
cache accordingly.  I have attached mine.  This is tweaked for Menlo Park;
note that if you're in MtV you should list engdns1 first.

   Why not?  pthread_mutex_lock is defined in libthread.so.  In fact, it's
   synonymous with mutex_lock - they're both WEAK aliases for _mutex_lock.

   The libpthread.so library uses libthread.so as a filter.

Oops, I think John's right, they did a little more hocus-pokus
with pragma's then I recalled.

Thanks for the explanation, I get the idea now.

 >> Can you tell me more about this?  What are the main benefits you'd
 >> expect to see?

 Kevin> reduced startup time, reduced working set.

Why will working set be reduced?  Each program will still demand the
same services.  Will working set be reduced purely because of the
reduced relocation burden we'd get from further scoping?

 Kevin> Some things like Motif and Xt have to remain in their own lib.

Why can't they also be part of the huge library?  Is it because we need
to make them available when CDE is absent?


If we only use DtSvc and DtWidget, then I would guess the benefit will
be rather minimal.  I wouldn't think it's worth adding DtTerm to this
huge library, since only the following 3 libs use DtTerm:

702 kontiki%> for i in /usr/dt/bin/*(x)           ~/evian/cdesrc/cde1/dtcm/dtcm
 {
 if file $i | grep ELF > /dev/null &&
    ldd $i | grep DtTerm > /dev/null ; then echo "$i uses libDtTerm" ; fi
 }
/usr/dt/bin/dtbuilder uses libDtTerm
/usr/dt/bin/dtcodegen uses libDtTerm
/usr/dt/bin/dtterm uses libDtTerm

(don't worry about the zsh extended globbing ;)

.. and we don't want to take the extra data relocation hits for the
majority of apps that don't use this library.

Also, libDtHelp needn't be in the huge library, since it's already
dlopen'd only when needed.

 >>  2. Won't this "mega" library cause very simple CDE apps (that would
 >> otherwise just use a subset of the libs) to suffer a large startup
 >> penalty for all the data relocations?
 >> 

 Kevin> Maybe but what is a "simple" CDE app anyway?

Perhaps, but I was thinking more in terms of third party apps that may
use just one of the CDE libs, such as DtWidget to get ComboBoxes, or
DtSvc to get some part of the kitchen sink ;)

Also, when we eventually switch to Motif 2.0, DtSvc will become
obsolete, since the ComboBox, SpinBox, etc will be implemented in Motif.
I really hope we can then get rid of the whole library, but I would
guess there'll be binary compatibility issues.

                Silicon Valley SIGGRAPH November Meeting

                     Pixar and Disney's 'Toy Story'

        Rick Sayre, Ronen Barzel, Rich Quade, and  Hal Hickel, Pixar

                    Tuesday, November 28, 1995
                    Apple Auidtorium
                    4 Infinite Loop
                    Cupertino

                    7:30 pm Networking & Socializing
                    8:00 pm Meeting
                    Admission free, open to all and to all ages!

As Steve Jobs told us all in his keynote speech at SIGGRAPH '95 last
summer in Los Angeles, 1995 is the 100th anniversary of the first
moving picture.  1995 will be significant in motion picture history for
a second reason.  The soon-to-be-released feature length movie, 'Toy
Story', co-produced and animated by Pixar and Disney Studios is the
first feature length film whose frames are 100% computer generated.
Come to the SIGGRAPH meeting to hear from the principal developers how
the movie was made and all about mind boggling facts such as: the
number of gigabytes (terabytes?) of disk to store the animation frames,
the hours (years?) of CPU time for generating them, and, of course,
inside stories about how some of the magical effects were produced.


Directions (for those of you in Santa Clara County):
From Highway 280, take the De Anza Boulevard off ramp south towards
Cupertino.
Turn left at Mariani.
Turn left into the second driveway.
The auditorium is in building 4, the second building on the right.

1. Introduction
	1.1. Project/Component Working Name: 
		X Windows, Motif, and Graphics API Compatability Links

	1.2. Name of Document Author/Supplier: William E. Sweeney Jr.

	1.3. Date of This Document:
		11/22/95

	1.4. Name of Major Document Customer(s)/Consumer(s): 
		IGSC, DTSC, SAC

2. Description
	SunSoft currently exports the X Windows, Motif, and graphics APIS
	in file system locations which differ from industry standard practice.
	The run libraries (header files) are located in
	 /usr/lib (/usr/include) /on SGI,DEC, and IBM platforms while in
	Solaris they are scattered about the file system.
	
	Simply stated, the goal of this project is to modify the system
	so that a program using OpenGL and Motif can be compiled and
	linked with the simple command line

		cc -o program program.c -lGL -lXm -lX11
	
	and then run correctly without requiring that LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	be set. 
	
	If we continue on our current path, the required command line 
	will be something like  
 
		cc -I/usr/dt/include -I/usr/openwin/include -o program program.c 
-L/usr/dt/lib -L/usr/openwin/lib -L/opt/SUNWits/Graphics-sw/GL/lib  
-R/opt/SUNWits/Graphics-sw/GL/lib:/usr/dt/lib:/usr/openwin/lib

	This will be accomplished by creating symbolic links in /usr/lib
	and /usr/include which make the files that define the APIs appear
	to be located there.

	Compatability with previous Solaris releases will be maintained.

3. External Requestor
	None.

4. Opportunity Window/Exposure
	It would be useful if this project were released coincident with
	the bundling of CDE and our adoption of Release 6 of the X Window
	system and OpenGL which are currently planned for Solaris 2.6.

5. Business Opportunity/Exposure
	Currently programmers moving Motif and OpenGL programs 
	to Solaris need to make a bunch of annoying changes to their
	Makefiles because SunSoft does not place the bundled components
	in file system locations that appear bundled.

	SGI, DEC, and IBM follow the proposed model. Given that we are
	trying to capture OpenGL applications which currently run on
	these platforms it will be advantageous to make it as easy to
	port to Solaris as possible.

6. Technical Description
	Due to partitioning and backward compatibility considerations we
	do not propose moving the actual files, but rather to put symbolic
	links into /usr/include and /usr/lib.

	This will be accomplished by at least 2 new packages for the
	Solaris WOS.

		1. Runtime package: symbolic links for the dynamic libraries
		     This package must be installed on ALL systems whether
		     or not the libraries the links point to are installed
		     (/usr/dt and or /usr/openwin might be nfs mounted).
		     Example:
			  File			 is a link to 
		        /usr/lib/libGL.so --->	/usr/lib/libGL.so.1
			/usr/lib/libGL.so.1    (whereverGL goes)/lib/libGL.so.1
			/usr/lib/libXm.so	/usr/lib/libXm.3
			/usr/lib/libXm.so.3	/usr/dt/lib/libXm.3
			/usr/lib/libX11.so     /usr/lib/libX11.so.6  
			/usr/lib/libX11.so.6   /usr/openwin/lib/libX11.so.6
			    etc

		2. Header file package
		     symbolic links for the windows header file directories
			/usr/include/X11 ----> /usr/openwin/include/X11
			/usr/include/Xm  ----> /usr/dt/include/Xm
			/usr/include/GL  ----> /usr/openwin/include/GL
				etc
		     This package must be installed on all systems which
		     have SUNWhea installed even if the window system headers
		     themselves are not because /usr/openwin and /usr/dt
		     are often nfs mounted.

	If desired, the components could be split into pairs of
	packages which match the consolidations, that is WPS would
	create packages for the core X windows libraries, the CDE team
	would create them for their libraries etc.  Since these
	components are stable and changes to them are carefully
	reviewed by the ARCs it might be argued that a single set of
	packages be used for the sake of simplicity. Another option
	would be to simply add the library links to SUNWcsu and the header
	links in SUNWhea.

    So, the choice is, (a) run on 2.4 and maintain our code separately forever,
    or (b) abandon 2.4 and create code that we're likely to be able to
    sell back to the shared implementation.

Well, the first choice is really to fix Xthreads so that we can write
portable code, yet use whichever implementation is most appropriate.

    It seems to me that the cost of (a) is theoretically unbounded while
    the benefits (CDE running on 2.4) are limited now and decreasing
    all the time.  But I guess we really need those millions of dollars
    of revenue we're getting from unbundled CDE sales to 2.4 customers,
    eh?

I agree that (a) has additional cost, but "theoretically unbounded" makes it
sound immense, which I don't believe it is.  The motivation for not pursuing
(b) -- i.e. continuing to support 2.4 -- is not incremental revenue from
sales of CDE, but is the additional penetration into the customer base of
systems running 2.4, which is significant.  I believe this is critical for
the success of CDE.

I believe the OpCom pthreads wrappers are unsupported.  This means that if
we use it, we'll have to take on responsibility for it ourselves.  Offhand
I'm not sure how much effort this is.  My gut feeling is that fixing
Xthreads is probably a better idea, since it allows us to write code that's
acceptable to the XC.

I just spoke with Gary and Greg.  I've got the architecture document for
the new back end and I'll be reading through it over the next couple of
days.  In a nutshell, the threading will be done by the back-end, and
the front-end will be modified to use asynchronous calls to the back-end
for certain operations.

auto-save handling is independent of the new backend design, and will be
addressed separately later on, once the new stuff is working.

Trip Report
Fifth Annual Motif/CDE Users Conference
In Conjunction with Open Systems World / FedUNIX
Washington DC
16-17 November 1995
Stuart W. Marks

INTRODUCTION

The Motif'95 Conference is just one of eleven programs that make up the Open
Systems World / FedUNIX conference.  Other programs included UNIX Network
Security, Open Client/Server Solutions, Essential Internet/WWW, Linux, etc.
This was a very quiet conference.  There were about thirty paid attendees
for the Motif'95 program.  (Trivia: ten percent of the paid attendees were
from Sun.)  There was one room for the Motif'95 program, and there were
usually between thirty and forty people attending.  The Washington
Convention Center wasn't crowded.  There were other activities going on at
the same time (unrelated to OSW/FedUNIX) so it was hard to gauge how many
people were present in total.  I didn't make it onto the trade show floor;
I'm hoping another attendee will write up a trip report that describes what
the trade show was like.  There were full-day courses scheduled for earlier
in the week, and we weren't there for them, so I don't know about the
attendance at those times.

There seemed to be *many* speakers lined up for Motif'95, perhaps forty or
fifty.  The speaker registration table was quite filled with badges.  Many
speakers arrived, gave presentations or whatever, and left shortly
thereafter, so there weren't that many people there at one time.  Some
speakers were even no-shows, leading to gaps in the agenda!  The tendency of
the Motif'95 program chair (Robert Belanger) to make last-minute changes to
the agenda and even to try to rearrange the schedule on the fly lent the
program a generally amateurish air.

CDE ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

My purpose in attending was twofold.  The first reason was to give an
overview talk on CDE architecture.  (This is similar to the talk that Steve
Evans has given several times.)  I was going to use Steve's presentation
materials, but it was in PowerPoint -- intended to be projected from a PC
laptop -- and that, combined with my being uncomfortable with the
organization of the materials in that presentation, led me to re-do the
presentation in Frame on transparencies for an overhead projector.  This was
unfortunate, but it did have the side benefit of producing a presentation
that I think anybody can use with little trouble.  See

	~smarks/work/fedunix/cdearch/cdearch.fm

for the presentation in Frame format.

Overall, the presentation went smoothly.  Some interesting issues arose in
the Q&A after my presentation.

	Q. "Why is CDE not the default desktop in Solaris 2.5?"

	I fumbled around a bit but managed to come up with a reasonable
	answer to the effect of, we're committed to CDE, and we're shipping
	it with every copy of 2.5, but making it the default would be too
	disruptive to our installed base.  I felt this to be somewhat lame,
	but at least passable.  Is there an official line on this?

	Q. "You're the latest in a long line of people to claim that the
	Motif in CDEnext is compatible with Motif 2.0.  [Subtext: I don't
	believe this.]  What's the real story?"

	The Motif 2.0 widget classes will all be there.  Missing will be
	CStext widget, C++ classes, and incompatible UIL changes.  CDEnext
	Motif is not totally compatible with Motif 2.0, but is mostly there.
	Priority for CDEnext Motif compatibity will be with CDE 1.0 Motif,
	not with Motif 2.0.  

	In a panel session later on, Scheifler labeled Motif 2.0 as either
	an "orphan" or as a "curiosity".  (I'm not sure which; a questioner
	might have used one of these words and Scheifler used the other.)
	In my panel presentation the next day I attempted to refute this, by
	stressing that, since CDEnext Motif isusing the Motif 2.0 source
	base, it really is Motif 2.0 modulo the exceptions mentioned above.
	This seemed to placate the audience, but the concern about
	"orphaning" the Motif 2.0 customers is there (for what it's worth,
	which is a good question.)

	Q&A from CDE presentation
	- interest in CDE on free Unixes (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD)

There was also a query about the availability of CDE on free Unixes like
Linux or FreeBSD.  I avoided mentioning any specifics, but I said that I was
aware of at least one third party that might be providing CDE ports to one
of the free Unixes.

PANEL: CDE AND THE FUTURE OF ENTERPRISE COMPUTING

My other reason for attending the conference was to sit on this panel.  It
was run by Mike Lambert, VP and Chief Technical Officer of X/Open.  I gave a
presentation on CDEnext that Hal Jespersen gave on a similar panel at UNIX
Expo back in September.  I think I did a pretty good job on it, as Doug Rand
(SGI East Coast) said later that I almost had him convinced that CDE was a
good idea.  (Heck, I almost convinced myself. :-)

One question directed at me was "Are we to be spared differences among the
vendors' CDE products?" implying that he didn't want any divergence at all.
Mike Lambert cut in and gave an answer before I could start, which is just
as well because I probably wouldn't have done nearly as good a job as
Lambert did.  Lambert's answer was that CDE guarantees a base level of
interoperability, but that the vendors can *and should* innovate atop CDE,
because the day they stop innovating, the industry will die.  He did stress
that adherence to CDE standards are a contractual obligation of holding the
X/Open brand, so that there wouldn't be divergence in those areas.

CDE will be primary desktop on next version of Digital UNIX (fka OSF/1).

There was general muttering in the audience about the lack of credibility of
the CDE joint development partners.  CDE is out there, so why is a little
company like TriTeal outmarketing the CDE partners?  The lack of CDE
marketing from the partners undermines CDE's credibility; the impression was
that we (the partners) must not be serious about CDE after all, in spite of
our saying so.  The audience would like to see more joint marketing from the
CDE partners.

Someone asked Jon Werner about TriTeal's ad "slamming" Scott McNealy, and
commented that this indicated that the CDE partners weren't one big happy
family. [!]  Werner dodged, saying that the TriTeal ad was really quite
complimentary to Sun, saying that CDE (and TED) validated Sun's "The Network
IS the Computer" slogan, and that TriTeal had merely modified the slogan to
be "The Network is the Desktop".  Hm, I reread it and it still seemed like a
dig at Sun and Scott McNealy to me.

I spoke with some customers who would like to see cheaper source licensing.
They want the source just for inspection and debugging; they don't need
redistribution rights.  They could even get by with just the source to the
libraries, not the applications, since they only need library source to
assist their debugging.

OTHER PRESENTATIONS

Bob Scheifler's keynote address was the standard Broadway presentation.
This basically is a thrust by the XC to make web pages "come alive" by
embedding remotely-running X applications within them.  This material is
available elsewhere so I won't go into detail about it here.

There was a panel session, "Experts Predict The Future" consisting of the
following people:

	Peter Winston, ICS
	Michael Foody, Visual Edge
	Bob Scheifler, XC
	Derek Lambert, Imperial Software Technology (maker of X/Designer)

Michael Foody showed the 1040OC form (Tax on Organized Crime Income -- a
joke) for some reason or other.  I'm not sure what his point was here.  This
is a PostScript sample of form 1040E from Adobe that was doctored in 1984 or
so by a fellow named Phil Barth at Stanford Center for Integrated Systems.
(He's now at HP Labs.)  I have a copy posted on the bulletin board outside
my office.

Derek Lambert (President of IST) said that Microsoft hasn't won the desktop.
He distinguishes between the personal desktop and the corporate desktop.
PCs have security & data integrity problem, e.g. you don't store customer
order records on the laptop you carry around to conferences.  He termed the
battle between the personal and corporate desktop as "Revolutionary War II".
(Revolutionary War I was PCs vs. mainframes.)  PCs embody liberty, freedom,
and power, but also anarchy, confusion, and chaos.  Networked corporate
desktops embody central control and tyranny, but also orderliness, safety,
and security.  The catalyst for RWII is the Internet and the Web.  [I'm not
sure I follow this line of reasoning.]

There was some talk of Java in this panel session, which occurred right
after my CDE Architecture Overview presentation.  Scheifler mentioned Java
in his keynote address, which was right before my presentation.  This led
Hinkmond to observe that the guy from Sun [i.e. me] was the only one who
didn't mention Java.  Ironic, that.

Interesting quotes:

	Scheifler: "Java was interesting when it was NeWS."

	Lambert: (paraphrase) "The problem with sex on the Internet will go
	away when they figure out how to charge for it."

Steven Mikes, editor of _The_X_Advisor_, former editor of _The_X_Journal_,
ran a presentation where he gave out the "X Industry Achievement Awards".
This was rather pathetic.  There were about twenty awards in all, with
fairly obscure categories (e.g.  Most Improved Graphical Application).  The
categories seemed arranged so that most of the little ISVs who produce X
products would get an award.  TriTeal got the Best Desktop award for
"TriTeal Extended Desktop".  (It's really TriTeal Enterprise Desktop.)  Jon
Werner accepted the award, saying that the error was no problem and that
he'd just file off the wrong word and have the correction re-engraved onto
the plaque.  I later congratulated Werner on the award, and someone nearby
who wasn't at the awards ceremony asked what the award was for.  Werner said
that it was for Best CDE Desktop Product Not From A CDE Development Partner.

The only technical presentation of note was Doug Rand's on the GoldenGate
digital media interchange project and on the MediaWarehouse project for
storing a library of digital media.  Both of these are SGI products or will
be soon.  Rand may try to get some of the GoldenGate interchange protocols
standardized through the X Consortium.

OTHER ITEMS OF INTEREST

Washington sure is a hopping place.  The following organizations had
meetings at the hotels where I stayed: Nation of Islam, Ambassadors for
Christ, and the National Jewish Coalition.

The Federal Government shutdown was timed perfectly badly.  The shutdown
occurred the day before we left for Washington, and services resumed the day
after we returned here.  This meant that none of the publicly-run museums
(e.g. Smithsonian) were open!  I did manage to spend some time at the
Corcoran Gallery and at the National Gallery of Caricature and Cartoon Art,
both of which were open because they are privately run.

RESTAURANTS

Zed's Ethiopian Cuisine
3318 M St. NW
Washington DC 20007
(202) 333-4710

Spicy Ethiopian food, eaten with one's fingers (the traditional way) from
a single platter in the middle of the table.  No utensils.

Crystal Thai Restaurant
4819 Arlington Boulevard (@ Park Drive)
Arlington VA 22203
(703) 522-1311

Straightforward Thai food, well prepared, well presented.

Xaymaca
M Street
Georgetown
(sorry, I didn't get the full information)

An inexpensive Jamaican restaurant.  The flavor wasn't bad, but the
restaurant seemed a bit rinkydink.  For instance, Each entree was served on
a plate with plain steamed rice and a salad consisting merely of shredded
iceberg lettuce.  For dressing, the waitress brought out several different
bottles of Kraft dressing.  Well, Georgetown is a college town; I guess I
need to set my expectations appropriately.

Cafe des Artistes (at the Corcoran Gallery)
500 Seventeenth Street, N.W.
Washington, DC 20006
(202) 638-1590

Lunch menu was rather trendy, as one might expect from a cafe in an art
museum.  Slightly on the expensive side.  I had a trio of smoked fish salad.
Very nice salad greens (esp. in comparison to Xaymaca's salad, above) and a
generous portion of smoked fish.  Also on the menu was a butternut squash
and ginger bisque, which was unfortunately not available when we were there.
Next time for sure.

Trip Report
Fifth Annual Motif/CDE Users Conference
In Conjunction with Open Systems World / FedUNIX
Washington DC
16-17 November 1995
Stuart W. Marks

INTRODUCTION

The Motif'95 Conference is just one of eleven programs that make up the Open
Systems World / FedUNIX conference.  Other programs included UNIX Network
Security, Open Client/Server Solutions, Essential Internet/WWW, Linux, etc.
This was a very quiet conference.  There were about thirty paid attendees
for the Motif'95 program.  (Trivia: ten percent of the paid attendees were
from Sun.)  There was one room for the Motif'95 program, and there were
usually between thirty and forty people attending.  The Washington
Convention Center wasn't crowded.  There were other activities going on at
the same time (unrelated to OSW/FedUNIX) so it was hard to gauge how many
people were present in total.  I didn't make it onto the trade show floor;
I'm hoping another attendee will write up a trip report that describes what
the trade show was like.  There were full-day courses scheduled for earlier
in the week, and we weren't there for them, so I don't know about the
attendance at those times.

There seemed to be *many* speakers lined up for Motif'95, perhaps forty or
fifty.  The speaker registration table was quite filled with badges.  Many
speakers arrived, gave presentations or whatever, and left shortly
thereafter, so there weren't that many people there at one time.  Some
speakers were even no-shows, leading to gaps in the agenda!  The tendency of
the Motif'95 program chair (Robert Belanger) to make last-minute changes to
the agenda and even to try to rearrange the schedule on the fly lent the
program a generally amateurish air.

CDE ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW

My purpose in attending was twofold.  The first reason was to give an
overview talk on CDE architecture.  (This is similar to the talk that Steve
Evans has given several times.)  I was going to use Steve's presentation
materials, but it was in PowerPoint -- intended to be projected from a PC
laptop -- and that, combined with my being uncomfortable with the
organization of the materials in that presentation, led me to re-do the
presentation in Frame on transparencies for an overhead projector.  This was
unfortunate, but it did have the side benefit of producing a presentation
that I think anybody can use with little trouble.  See

	~smarks/work/fedunix/cdearch/cdearch.fm

for the presentation in Frame format.

Overall, the presentation went smoothly.  Some interesting issues arose in
the Q&A after my presentation.

	Q. "Why is CDE not the default desktop in Solaris 2.5?"

	I fumbled around a bit but managed to come up with a reasonable
	answer to the effect of, we're committed to CDE, and we're shipping
	it with every copy of 2.5, but making it the default would be too
	disruptive to our installed base.  I felt this to be somewhat lame,
	but at least passable.  Is there an official line on this?

	Q. "You're the latest in a long line of people to claim that the
	Motif in CDEnext is compatible with Motif 2.0.  [Subtext: I don't
	believe this.]  What's the real story?"

	The Motif 2.0 widget classes will all be there.  Missing will be
	CStext widget, C++ classes, and incompatible UIL changes.  CDEnext
	Motif is not totally compatible with Motif 2.0, but is mostly there.
	Priority for CDEnext Motif compatibity will be with CDE 1.0 Motif,
	not with Motif 2.0.  

	In a panel session later on, Scheifler labeled Motif 2.0 as either
	an "orphan" or as a "curiosity".  (I'm not sure which; a questioner
	might have used one of these words and Scheifler used the other.)
	In my panel presentation the next day I attempted to refute this, by
	stressing that, since CDEnext Motif isusing the Motif 2.0 source
	base, it really is Motif 2.0 modulo the exceptions mentioned above.
	This seemed to placate the audience, but the concern about
	"orphaning" the Motif 2.0 customers is there (for what it's worth,
	which is a good question.)

	Q&A from CDE presentation
	- interest in CDE on free Unixes (e.g. Linux, FreeBSD)

There was also a query about the availability of CDE on free Unixes like
Linux or FreeBSD.  I avoided mentioning any specifics, but I said that I was
aware of at least one third party that might be providing CDE ports to one
of the free Unixes.

PANEL: CDE AND THE FUTURE OF ENTERPRISE COMPUTING

My other reason for attending the conference was to sit on this panel.  It
was run by Mike Lambert, VP and Chief Technical Officer of X/Open.  I gave a
presentation on CDEnext that Hal Jespersen gave on a similar panel at UNIX
Expo back in September.  I think I did a pretty good job on it, as Doug Rand
(SGI East Coast) said later that I almost had him convinced that CDE was a
good idea.  (Heck, I almost convinced myself. :-)

One question directed at me was "Are we to be spared differences among the
vendors' CDE products?" implying that he didn't want any divergence at all.
Mike Lambert cut in and gave an answer before I could start, which is just
as well because I probably wouldn't have done nearly as good a job as
Lambert did.  Lambert's answer was that CDE guarantees a base level of
interoperability, but that the vendors can *and should* innovate atop CDE,
because the day they stop innovating, the industry will die.  He did stress
that adherence to CDE standards are a contractual obligation of holding the
X/Open brand, so that there wouldn't be divergence in those areas.

CDE will be primary desktop on next version of Digital UNIX (fka OSF/1).

There was general muttering in the audience about the lack of credibility of
the CDE joint development partners.  CDE is out there, so why is a little
company like TriTeal outmarketing the CDE partners?  The lack of CDE
marketing from the partners undermines CDE's credibility; the impression was
that we (the partners) must not be serious about CDE after all, in spite of
our saying so.  The audience would like to see more joint marketing from the
CDE partners.

Someone asked Jon Werner about TriTeal's ad "slamming" Scott McNealy, and
commented that this indicated that the CDE partners weren't one big happy
family. [!]  Werner dodged, saying that the TriTeal ad was really quite
complimentary to Sun, saying that CDE (and TED) validated Sun's "The Network
IS the Computer" slogan, and that TriTeal had merely modified the slogan to
be "The Network is the Desktop".  Hm, I reread it and it still seemed like a
dig at Sun and Scott McNealy to me.

I spoke with some customers who would like to see cheaper source licensing.
They want the source just for inspection and debugging; they don't need
redistribution rights.  They could even get by with just the source to the
libraries, not the applications, since they only need library source to
assist their debugging.

Hi folks,

Each of the functions below is duplicated in TextF.o and TextOut.o
The number to the right is the function's byte size.

Unfortunately, the functions in TextF.c use a TextField widget and the
ones in TextOut.c use a Text widget, which makes it a little awkward to
merge each of these into one function.

Maybe it's something to consider for the future?

The problem also exists in Motif 2.0.

Hi Lynn,

How are you doing?  The small company didn't work out, so I finally came
back to Sun over here in the US!

I'm still getting mail addressed to that chap with a similar name to
mine, "Jonathan Cooper" who also used to work in the Sun UK.  I was
wondering if you know who's forwarding it to me?  It just seems a bit
wasteful to send it half way around the world, for me to just junk it in
the bin!

If you see anything addressed to "John Cooper", feel free to open it and
junk it if it looks like garbage.

Thanks,

    --- John.

Shouldn't the answer to this have been "CDE is just a source customer
of CDE, not one of the partners"?

Shouldn't the answer to this have been "CDE is just a source customer

This sounds to me like a pretty lame reason.  Surely, if a customer
wishes to edit the contents of his mailbox, he should be allowed to do
so.  After all, the customer owns the mailbox, and can even delete it,
so what's security got to do with it?  The customer can easily defeat
dtmail's so-called "security" by hand editing /var/mail/foo .

Both xmh and all the emacs mail readers allow the user to modify a
message.  I think it's bogus for dtmail to prohibit this.

This is not necessarily so. If your mailbox is accessed through a
remote server using a protocol such as imap, then messages are
*read only* and there is no facility provided for changing the
contents of a message. The customer can be prevented from gaining
access directly to the mailbox itself.

I believe the security reasons revolve around not making it easy
for someone to "doctor up" an e-mail message and have it appear
as though it was the original and then forward that message along.

Yes, a user can create e-mail with any contents the user wants,
and it can be made to appear as if it came from anywhere. Today.
But as the world moves to mail servers and away from flat files
and onto real data bases, this will become increasingly difficult
for the lesser skilled customers.

Of course, you can create a file with any contents and claim it
is original email, so from a certain point of view there is no
way to prevent this completely.

I personally dont agree with this restriction; I do think that if
you edit a piece of mail a "this was edited by x on y" header should
be included automagically, but otherwise it should be allowed. But
thats just my opinion.

No offense taken - I personally think it should be allowed but
properly controlled so it cannot accidentally be done (something
like "press this button to enable edit mode") and it should
leave an edit trail.

As with laws in general, if you cannot prevent it, it is better
to allow it and control it than to believe you can stop it.

I apologize for not keeping your informed on my status and progress in 
investigating the libnsl memory allocation problems.

I've been looking into each of the areas you described and have been 
trying to find a way of tackling the heap fragmentation problem;  the
other chunks of memory that remain allocated for the process' lifetime
have been OK (although I haven't looked at every single one of them
included in your original message).

Since there's a lot of "background" info and details involved in describing
what's happening and what I've discovered, can we sit down and chat with
this in your office or a nearby conference room?  I've uncovered many 
details about what's happening and some of the info about "why," so just
comparing notes should be productive...

Please let me know,

Hi Yvonne,

I just spoke with Jim to arrange a meeting - he's going to drop by this
Friday between 10:30 and 11:00.  Let me know if you'd like to attend (I
think it would be very useful) and I'll call you when he arrives.

    --- John.

What do COW and reordering have to do with the extra relocation cost?
Data is COW regardless of the introduction of a Mega lib.  I would
imagine that a reordering of the Mega lib will not yield much
improvement over separately reordering the smaller libs.

Hmm, do you mean make Motif 2.0 be an auxiliary filter onto the Mega
lib?  Since Motif 1.2.4 will not be part of the Mega lib, Motif 2.0 will
have a small subset of its symbols (the former DtWidgets) satisfied from
the filtee (Mega lib), but most of its symbols will be referenced
internally.  Plus, I'd be very surprised if the 2.0 widgets are
completely compatible with those in DtWidget.

Plus, what's the performance hit for more complicated symbol lookup when
using an auxiliary filter in this way?

So, overall, it's probably not worth doing, right?

Hi

Isn't that exactly where you started before you came here
- working for Sun in the US, or weren't you working for Sun?

It's suprising how many people leave for another job and then
come back a year or so later, my friend has done it twice and
now she's looking to come back for a third time!!!!!

Anyway I don't know why they keep posting the "other" blokes
stuff over to you, he left ages ago - it's Bagshot post room
by the way.  I'll drop them a mail and hopefully that'll be 
the end of it!!!

Well hope every thing goes well for you over there.

regards

Lynn

 Hi Lynn,
 
 How are you doing?  The small company didn't work out, so I finally came
 back to Sun over here in the US!
 
 I'm still getting mail addressed to that chap with a similar name to
 mine, "Jonathan Cooper" who also used to work in the Sun UK.  I was
 wondering if you know who's forwarding it to me?  It just seems a bit
 wasteful to send it half way around the world, for me to just junk it in
 the bin!
 
 If you see anything addressed to "John Cooper", feel free to open it and
 junk it if it looks like garbage.
 
 Thanks,
 
     --- John.

There was a knock on the door. It was the man from Microsoft.
"Not you again," I said.
"Sorry," he said, a little sheepishly. "I guess you know why I'm here."
Indeed I did. Microsoft's $300 million campaign to promote the Windows
95 operating system was meant to be universally effective, to convince
every human being on the planet that Windows 95 was an essential, some
would say integral, part of living.  Problem was, not everyone had bought
it.  Specifically, I hadn't bought it.  I was the Last Human Being Without
Windows 95.  And now this little man from Microsoft was at my door, and
he wouldn't take no for an answer.
"No," I said.
"You know I can't take that," he said, pulling out a copy of Windows
95 from a briefcase. "Come on.  Just one copy.  That's all we ask."
"Not interested."  I said.  "Look, isn't there someone else you can
go bother for a while?  There's got to be someone else on the planet who
doesn't have a copy." "Well, no,"  The Microsoft man said. "You're the
only one."
"You can't be serious.  Not everyone on the planet has a computer,"
I said.  "Hell, not everyone on the planet has a PC!  Some people own
Macintoshes, which run their own operating system.  And some people who
have PCs run OS/2, though I hear that's just a rumor.  In short, there
are some people who just have no use for Windows 95."
The Microsoft man look perplexed. "I'm missing your point," he said.
"Use!"  I screamed. "Use!  Use!  Use!  Why BUY it, if you can't USE it?"
"Well, I don't know anything about this 'use' thing you're going on
about," The Microsoft man said. "All I know is that according to our
records, everyone else on the planet has a copy."
"People without computers?"
"Got 'em."
"Amazonian Indians?"
"We had to get some malaria shots to go in, but yes."
"The Amish."
"Check."
"Oh, come on," I said. "They don't even wear BUTTONS.  How did you
get them to buy a computer operating system?"
"We told them there were actually 95 very small windows in the box,"
the Microsoft man admitted. "We sort of lied.  Which means we are all
going to Hell, every single employee of Microsoft."  He was somber for a
minute, but then perked right up. "But that's not the point!" he said.
"The point is, EVERYONE has a copy.  Except you."
"So what?"  I said. "If everyone else jumped off a cliff, would you
expect me to do it, too?"
"If we spent $300 million advertising it?  Absolutely."
"No."
"Jeez, back to that again," the Microsoft man said. "Hey.  I'll tell
you what.  I'll GIVE you a copy.  For free.  Just take it and install it
on your computer."  He waved the box in front of me.
"No," I said again. "No offense, pal.  But I don't need it.  And
frankly, your whole advertising blitz has sort of offended me.  I mean,
it's a computer operating system!  Great.  Fine.  Swell.  Whatever.  But
you guys are advertising it like it creates world peace or something."
"It did."
"Pardon?"
"World peace.  It was part of the original design.  Really.  One
button access.  Click on it, poof, end to strife and hunger.  Simple."
"So what happened?"
"Well, you know," he said. "It took up a lot of space on the hard
drive.  We had to decide between it or the Microsoft Network.  Anyway,
we couldn't figure out how to make a profit off of world peace."
"Go away," I said.
"I can't," he said. "I'll be killed if I fail."
"You have got to be kidding," I said.
"Look," the Microsoft man said, "We sold this to the AMISH.  The
Amish!  Right now, they're opening the boxes and figuring out they've been
had.  We'll be pitchforked if we ever step into Western Pennsyvania again.
But we did it.  So to have YOU holding out, well, it's embarassing.  It's
embarassing to the company.  It's embarassing to the product.  It's
embarassing to BILL."
"Bill Gates does not care about me," I said.
"He's watching right now," the Microsoft man said. "Borrowed one of
those military spy satellites just for the purpose.  It's also got one of
those high-powered lasers.  You close that door on me, zap, I'm a pile of
grey ash."
"He wouldn't do that," I said, "He might hit that copy of Windows 95
by accident."
"Oh, Bill's gotten pretty good with that laser," the Microsoft man
said, nervously.
"Okay.  I wasn't supposed to do this, but you leave me no choice.  If
you take this copy of Windows 95, we will reward you handsomely.  In fact,
we'll give you your own Caribbean island!  How does Montserrat sound?"
"Terrible.  There's an active volcano there."
"It's only a small one," the Microsoft man said.
"Look," I said, "even if you DID convince me to take that copy of
Windows 95, what would you do then?  You'd have totally saturated the
market.  That would be it.  No new worlds to conquer.  What would you do
then?"
The Microsoft man held up another box and gave it to me.
"'Windows 95...  For Pets'?!?!?"
"There's a LOT of domestic animals out there," he said.
I shut the door quickly.  There was a surprised yelp, the sound of a
laser, and then nothing.

		    ENS Software Services
	    Announces Support and Availability for
		   Netscape Navigator 1.12

			Production Test
		     Mountain View Campus


Netscape Navigator version 1.12 is being distributed tonight to all MTV 
SoftDist servers in a Production Test Phase.  The distribution is being 
phased in the various areas so it will be available in some areas prior 
to others. 

This web browser has increased functionality over Mosaic, v2.4, 
which has been available on SoftDist.  One of the most requested 
features is the ability to incorporate tables into your pages.
The browser will be configured to us an ENS supported Proxy server
which has the caching feature enabled.  Caching will help to reduce
SWAN bandwidth utilization for commonly visited pages.

If you are already a user of Netscape, you will be asked if you
would like to have your preferences file updated to use an ENS
supported proxy.   Your old preferences file will be saved prior 
to the update.  If you choose not to update your proxy server, 
you will continue to use your current server. Your preferences file 
will be checked for completeness and any missing required settings 
will be added. Additionally, your number of network connections will
be set to 2 (see usage note #1 below).

Usage Notes:

1. Keep your number of connections low. A setting of 2
   connections will provide adequate performance. Setting
   the number of connections too high will adversely
   affect the web performance for all users.

2. If you get what you believe is an outdated page, pressing the
   reload button will force the caching proxy to fetch the
   document from the remote host and not from cache. If this
   does not work try the following:

	Select Options -> Preferences
	Select Cache and Network (from the menu button)
	Click "Clear Memory Cache Now" and "OK"
	Click "Clear Disk Cache Now" and "OK"
	Click "OK" on the Preferences window
	Select Reload from the Browser

3. If you have a copy of the browser on your local system you should
   remove it at this time as you may get this version instead of the
   supported version. 


Licensing and Start Up

Sorry if you are seeing this again.   A few typos in the original
distribution list.   (It has been a long day.)  I have also added a few
related attachments.


I have some great news to share with you.   Today we FCSd Neutron.
Revenue shipments were made from both the US and the UK today.
I believe that this is the first time in the company's history that
we simultaneously FCSd a major platform from both manufacturing sites 
on the same day.  I expect that Neutron plus will FCS before this
week is over.

Many of you have been working very hard on this project for up to
4 years and the payoff came today.   We now have a great reason to
celebrate.   UltraComputing is now a reality for our customers.
The operations team still has a very challenging month ahead of us as we
work to ship our Q2 revenue goals, and begin to ship Early Release
Electrons.  We are now on our way and we will make it happen.

We should all be very proud of what we have accomplished in making
FCS happen today especially when you consider what has happened in the factory
in the past few weeks.   We have had to incorporate a PROM code 
change which was released via emergency ECO just yesterday.  This has
required us to rework hundreds of systems and thousands of boards.  We have
endured several purges, major reworks, and stop ships.   We have struggled to 
overcome
a lot of adversity to make this happen.    In addition to shipping 
product, over the past few weeks our efforts have shown clearly that 
product quality and customer satisfaction are important to us.

I am very proud of what we have all accomplished.

Tom

This bloke is crawling through the desert, hasnt had a drink in days,
let alone a beer.  The sun is beating down.  He's hot.
The skin is peeling of his back, and he knows hes gonna get melanoma
for sure.
He sees this bedouin ('cuse the spelling, one of those desert type
people who wear flowing robes and stuff. Forgive the lack of PC.)
anyway, this bloke goes up to this guy and goes "water! Water! gimme water !"
the desert-type-person goes "ties! ties! good silk tie only $30!' 
the bloke goes "shove your ties I need water!" at which point the
desert-type-person vanishes into the swirling sand.

This bloke crawls on a bit more and he sees another of these
desert-type-persons, and  goes "water! Water! gimme water !"
the desert-type-person goes 'ties, ties, good silk tie only $30' 
the bloke goes "shove your ties I need water!" at which point the
second desert-type-person vanishes into the swirling sand.

This bloke crawls on a bit more and he sees another of these

the desert-type-person goes 'ties, ties, good silk tie only $30' 
the bloke goes "shove your ties I need water!" at which point the
third desert-type-person vanishes into the swirling sand.

After a bit this poor joker stumbles onto a bar, complete with
breweries signs, cigarette smoke and the smell of beer.
he drags himself up to the door and says to the doorman "water! Water!
gimme water !"
The doorman says to him "sod off mate, you need a tie to get into this place."

This woman walks into an adult boutique. 
 
She walks up to the clerk and the clerk notices that she seems to be shaking
all over.  He's wondering if she's ill or something.

She asks him , "D-D-D-o-o-o y-y-y-ou sell 10" v-v-v-ibrators ?".

He tells her , "Why, yes we do.".

So she asks, "Are th-th-th-ey 6" around and made by ACME adult
nov-nov-elties ? "

The clerks answers, "Yes thats the model we sell."

"Well", she says, "How d-d-o-o you turn the d-d-damn thing OFF ! "

- - ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 A tourist wanders into a back-alley antique shop in San Francisco's
 Chinatown. Picking through the objects on display he discovers a
 detailed, life-sized bronze sculpture of a rat. The sculpture is so
 interesting and unique that he picks it up and asks the shop owner
 what it costs.

 "Twelve dollars for the rat, sir," says the shop owner, "and a
 thousand dollars more for the story behind it."

 "You can keep the story, old man," he replies, "but I'll take the
 rat."

 The transaction complete, the tourist leaves the store with the
 bronze rat under his arm. As he crosses the street in front of the
 store, two live rats emerge from a sewer drain and fall into step
 behind him. Nervously looking over his shoulder, he begins to walk
 faster, but every time he passes another sewer drain, more rats come
 out and follow him. By the time he's walked two blocks, at least a
 hundred rats are at his heels, and people begin to point and shout.
 He walks even faster, and soon breaks into a trot as multitudes of
 rats swarm from sewers, basements, vacant lots, and abandoned cars.
 Rats by the thousands are at his heels, and as he sees the waterfront
 at the bottom of the hill, he panics and starts to run full tilt.

 No matter how fast he runs, the rats keep up, squealing hideously,
 now not just thousands but millions, so that by the time he comes
 rushing up to the water's edge a trail of rats twelve city blocks
 long is behind him. Making a mighty leap, he jumps up onto a light
 post, grasping it with one arm while he hurls the bronze rat into San
 Francisco Bay with the other, as far as he can heave it.  Pulling his
 legs up and clinging to the light post, he watches in amazement as
 the seething tide of rats surges over the breakwater into the sea,
 where they drown.

 Shaken and mumbling, he makes his way back to the antique shop.

 "Ah, so you've come back for the rest of the story," says the owner.

 "No," says the tourist, "I was wondering if you have a bronze
lawyer."

This report is based on the feedback generated from the customers who
downloaded CDE 1.0 from the external web page.

This report will give you a rough idea of where our customers are and
what they are doing in the desktop area. It is merely a dump of all
of the incoming data (sorry, we don't have any sophisticated report
utilities yet).  The feedback form customers used can be found
on:  http://sun-www.ebay.sun.com/cgi-bin/gen-form2.pl 

There were 2871 responses (some of which came from the same person/site).

For this report, I've included responses to the following questions: 
(Note: for most of the questions, customers were given specific options)

	What is your main business?
	What is your primary desktop operating system you use at work?
	Do you have a second desktop at your office?
	If you use Sun Workstations, do you use a GUI?
	How do you run your applications?
	What are your top 3 applications used on your Sun workstation?
	What are your top 3 applicatoins used on your PC?
	Which tools do you use from the Solaris Deskset?
	How many employees are in your company?
	What is your total company revenues?
	What Country are you from?
	
We also have detailed customer information (name, address, phone, etc.)
for anyone needing more information.
	
If you have any questions, please let me know.

John,
Kevin passed this compilation cmd line on to me as a suggested switch
set to use in cde compilations.

Would you please study up on these and make sure they are appropriate
for CDE builds and that they make a performance difference.

Don't do a lot of perf testing - get some speed and size measurements
on one of the cde apps.

I want to do a santity check before we ask the cde build folk to
use these switches.
-D

Could you please complete the following by Wed, Dec 6.
I don't think it's going to be a lot more work over and
above what we talked about today since
you already build CDE components on your machine.

  1. Compile dtmail and dtcm with the compiler switches
     Kevin sent me.
  2. Size and test one of these apps for performance - your choice.
  3. Send me a pointer to the apps (and libs if you compile
     them too) so that I can run them on my DT for a day
     to do a superficial compiler-function test.
     (I want you to build dtmail because of it's C++ construction,
      this will give me C and C++ samples - same C flags needed???)
      Also, I am told that the mail team has a comprehensive function
      test suite. Make arrangements to have them test the 4.0
      compiled mail and tell them we need some answers by Wed.

  4. Find out from the compiler people or Kevin, if he knows:
     Are these switches valid across all the different
	architectures (CDE needs to know this to gauge how
	complicated build configs might become).

        Note:It's my understanding there are *no* 4.x compilers
	for the i86 architecture. The most current compiler
	release is 3.0.1 - will this compiler also take the
	flags Kevin recommended? Will this be an issue given
	that Imake is used to config the CDE builds?

Thanks,
-D

You are correct regarding the ARC position. I've enclosed below the mail
that I got from ASARC regarding stuff in this repository.

This is one of those phase 2 things that will probably have an impact
on the phase 1 work (there's several of these). Phase 1 is mostly
defining what storage mechanism & administration must be in place to
house, submit, administer and distribute common stuff. Then, phase 2
addresses the criteria around what goes into this repository, like
ARC approvals, engineering reviews, and the like. What this all boils
down to, and what you're alluding to, is determining a level of approval
for a common component. Yes, the repository must have some way to indicate
what the level of approval is for a component. Being able to indicate
a level of approval (whatever 'approval' ends up meaning) MUST be addressed
in phase 1. Defining what 'approval' is leads into phase 2. Approval is not
totally generic for all types of components, but there are common approval
criteria, including the obvious ARC approval. One thing that the repository
MUST allow for is the sharing of components that are under development, that
haven't been ARC approved yet, so that 2 or more projects under development
that want to share something new, can do so prior to ARC approval.

Thanks for bringing this to everyone's attention. This effort is a bit
tricky breaking up into several phases, and we realize that we can't
ignore the component criteria when addressing the repository mechanics.
We've got a good handle on the generic criteria that the repository must
enforce, like specifying a level of support, level of approval, supporting
documentation, etc., and we'll make sure that our phase 1 efforts reflect
these. We've still got a lot of this to hash out, but we'll be starting
at the sunteam meeting today nailing this down.

stay tuned...

------ASARC position on common components & the ARCs-----

        Hi Don,
                Thanks for your e-mail, we discussed it at the last
        arc-chairs meeting, and we are certainly very supportive of your efforts
        to institute such an initiative. Unfortunately, although SAC would
        seem to be an appropriate organisation to administer such a code
        repository, we are not currently in a position to adopt such a
        responsibility. However, it would certainly seem appropriate for the
        ARC's (ASARC) to properly review all UI components that were to be
        included in your repository. Initially I would suggest that we either
        review individual components prior to their inclusion into the
        repository, or lazily review components as they are included into
        product from the repository.
 
        I recommend the former so that potential customers of a component
        know that they may use it in the knowledge that it is approved.
        Furthermore, although I am sympathetic to your concerns regarding the
        negative impact the overhead of a "full" ARC review may have on the
        success of the repository, I suggest that the existing review process
        is appropriate for the review of such components and would not result
        in a substantive overhead for potential contributors, given that the
        relative lack of complexity (compared to a fully blown product project
        review) and stylised nature of UI components would lend themselves to a
        fairly simple review.
 
        One major concern that I have regarding the repository is how developers
        will deploy components from it into their product, it seems to me that
        the way in which components are delivered into the end product could
        be a major issue. I for one would recommend a scheme whereby individual
        components be delivered into the system in a single location where a
        single instance of a UI component may be shared by multiple clients,
        have you had any thoughts on this.
 
        Anyway I hope this feedback is useful, please let us know how we may
        assist you further.
 
        Rgds
 
        - Larry Cable, ASARC chair.

			  MODEMPOOL INSTRUCTIONS
		     FOR XYLOGICS / NOMADIC PLATFORM 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Your request for a nomadic modempool account is being processed.  Your
digital token card used to access your nomadic modem pool account on
the new annex2 server is being sent to you by Federal Express, or Sun
shuttle service if you are within the San Franciso Bay Area.

To complete the account set-up, you will need to call for your token
card PIN from a Sun location when you receive your card.  Since there
are situations where the users are not able to go to a Sun location
(traveling, working at an off-site location, etc.), the users may, at
their discretion, give the digital token administrator telephone
authorization to give their PIN to another Sun employee who is located
in a Sun facility.

PIN's are *not* to given out via e-mail, or left in voicemail/answering
machine messages.  They *must* be given directly to the user over the
phone or in person.

Do not keep the PIN with the token card.

Your card will be activated within 24 hours from the time you receive
your PIN.  Any existing dialback account(s) will be deleted when the
nomadic account is set up.

	X34218 (408-276-4218)	8:00 a.m. to 11:30 a.m. (Pacific Time)
	X30582 (408-276-0582)	1:00 p.m. to  4:00 p.m. (Pacific Time)

The new Xylogics Nomadic modempool platform supports V.34 (28.8Kbps)
speeds, and uses U.S. Robotics modems.

Following are login instructions and set up guidelines.  Should you have
any problems with your account, please place a trouble ticket via 
servicedesk (service&) or call the Help Desk at 408/276-3666.

***NOTE:  CONTRACTOR AND TEMP ACCOUNTS WILL EXPIRE IN CONJUNCTION
	  WITH BADGE EXPIRATION, WHICH USUALLY FALLS ON 7/30 AND 1/31
	  UNLESS EXTENDED BY SUN'S SECURITY GROUP.  TO EXTEND ACCESS,
	  YOU WILL NEED TO COMPLETE THE REBADGING PROCESS AND THEN
	  SUBMIT A SERVICEDESK TICKET, SELECTING THE REMOTE ACCESS
	  ICON, CONTRACTOR A/C EXT SELECTION.  ACCOUNTS NOW BEING
	  ISSUED WILL EXPIRE ON 1/31/96.***

Your digital token card is now used to obtain a dynamic password.

** Turn on the digital token card enter the following as
   prompted on the token card LCD.

 -  The LCD on the token card will display "EP" (ENTER PIN)

 -  Enter your 5 digit PIN  (Note: older cards have a 4 digit pin)

 -  The LCD will read "EH" (ENTER HOST)

 -  Enter the number 9 (X9.9 host)

 -  The token card will display "0" (indicating you are to enter

Workstation 4.x Setup:
----------------------
Following are instructions on how to establish connection from a home IPC 
Sun Workstation (dialing in via a Robotics V.32 modem) to the Sun network.

1. Connect your Robotics V.32 modem to the phone line and serial port A 
   of your IPC. Make sure that switch 5 at the rear of the modem is OFF
   (ie. up) and switch 8 is set ON (ie.down).

2. Setup the modem software as described in "Sun System & Network 
   Manager's Guide", with some modifications as stated below--

   To set up software for a modem connected to serial port A of IPC:
   (Note. you only need to do steps a-k one time only.)

 	a. Become superuser.
 	b. Type:  eeprom ttya-ignore-cd=true and press Return.
 	c. Type:  eeprom ttya-rts-dtr-off=true and press Return.
 	d. Halt and reboot your workstation. Login as root again.
 	e. Type:  mknod /dev/cua1 c 12 128, and press Return.
    	   Type:  chmod 666 /dev/cua1, and press Return.
    	   Type:  chown uucp /dev/cua1, and press Return.
 	f. Type:  ln /dev/cua1 /dev/cua2, and press Return.
 	g. Make a backup copy of /etc/remote (i.e. /etc/remote2)
 	h. Type:  /usr/ucb/vi /etc/remote and press Return.
    	   Edit the /etc/remote file as follows (see steps i-k).
 	i. While in VI, make a copy of the two-line entry beginning 
	   hardwire:\ and paste the entry just before any of the entries 
	   beginning with tip in the /etc/remote file.
    		WARNING: Be sure to copy the entry -- do NOT attempt to type 
		in the /etc/remote entry for your modem. It contains some 
		special control characters that are difficult to insert with 
		the text editor.
 	j. In the new entry, change the word 'hardwire' to 'modem' and change 
	   the word 'ttyb' to 'cua1'. The result will look like the following:
    		Before change-
    			hardwire:\
          		:dv=/dev/ttyb:br#9600:el=^C^S^Q^U^D:ie=%$:oe=^D:
    		After change-
    			modem:\
           		:dv=/dev/cua1:br#38400:el=^C^S^Q^U^D:ie=%$:oe=^D:
	k. Type :wq! to save the updates in /etc/remote.

3. Now you can open a shelltool window under OpenWindow and try to dial out.
   WARNING. Do NOT enable scrolling in your shelltool window or use a 
   cmdtool window to dial out.

4. To connect to the modem, in a shelltool window, type:   tip modem

5. To dial out, type: atdt (modempool number), i.e. atdt 18002244479

6. See Dial-in and Log-on Procedures for more instructions.

------------------------------------------------------------
Workstation 5.x setup:  Modem with Solaris 2.x
------------------------------------------------------------

If you have a system that was built without any changes to the
default eeprom values, skip to step 4

If this fails, bring up admintool and make sure you have 'software
carrier' and 'initialize only' checked. 

1. Halt the system.

2. From the PROM new command mode, type:

   setenv ttya-ignore-cd true <CR>   
	(Carrier-detect signal is ignored, and passed on to the kernel)

   setenv ttya-rts-dtr-off false <CR> 
	(Sun does not assert DTR and RTS)

3. reset or power cycle the system.

4. Make sure the modem is properly connected and configured.
   Make sure the cable is ok.
   Here assumes that the modem cable to serial port A.

5. Edit /etc/remote (as root) and insert this line:

   modem:\
           :dv=/dev/term/a:br#38400:el=^C^S^Q^U^D:ie=%$:oe=^D:

6. To connect to the modem, at your prompt, type:    tip modem
	You should get the response "connected"

7. To dial out, type: 	atdt (modempool number) i.e. 18002244479

8. See Dial-in and Log-on Procedures for more instructions.

##########################################################################

Common problems users experience with their digital token card:

o	Vertical lines scroll across the LCD of the token card:

	Entering your PIN incorrectly three consecutive times will cause
	the card to go into a delay state where it will not accept any
	keypad input.  LEAVE THE CARD TURNED ON UNTIL IT RESETS ITSELF 
	and displays "EP" (enter PIN). After this has happened, each time 
	a wrong PIN is entered the card will go into this delay state.  
	Leave the card turned on until it resets itself.

o	"Attack lockout activated."

	After four consective wrong passwords, you will see "Attack
	lockout activated." displayed on your screen.  You must wait 30
	minutes for the attack lockout to clear itself.

o	"Your record currently in use." 

	If your screen displays "Your record currently in use.", there
	has been a problem with the database and you must place a trouble
	ticket via servicedesk, remote access icon, or call the Help Desk 
	(408/276-3666).
	
o	Token card LCD displays "00000000".

	If the token card LCD displays eight 0's, the programming of
	the card has been lost and the card will need to be replaced.
	Submit a servicedesk ticket, via remote access icon, token
	card replacement.  If you do not have access to servicedesk,
	please call the Help Desk at 408/276-3666.
	
o	Lost/Stolen/Broken token cards.

	If your digital token card is lost or stolen, immediately
	notify the Help Desk to ensure the card is deactivated.  To
	obtain a replacement card, submit a request via servicedesk,
	remote access icon, token card replacement option.  If you do
	not have access to servicedesk, please call the Help Desk at
	408/276-3666.

	If digital token card is broken (e.g., LCD breaks, battery
	wears out), request a new card via servicedesk.
  

o	Terminated Employee token cards.
	
	Cards issued to employees who terminate should be returned for
	reprogramming and reissuance.  Cards are not transferrable, and 
	should not be given to any user other than the user the card was
	originally assigned to.

Cards that need to be returned should be sent back to:

   Home Workstation setup:

   The following are instructions on how to establish connection 
   from a home IPC Sun Workstation (dialing in via a Robotics V.32 modem) 
   to the Sun network.

   1. First you need to add your home callback phone number to the high 
   speed modem pool data base.


   2. Connect your Robotics V.32 modem to the phone line and serial port A 
   of your IPC. Make sure that switch 5 at the rear of the modem is off
   (ie. up) and switch 8 is set on (ie.down).


   3. Setup the modem software as described in "Sun System & Network 
   Manager's Guide", with some modifications as stated below--

   
   To set up software for a modem connected to serial port A of IPC:
   (Note. you only need to do steps a-k one time only, once it is set up 
    you do not need to do it again)

   a. Become superuser.
   b. Type eeprom ttya-ignore-cd=false and press Return.
   c. Type eeprom ttya-rts-dtr-off=true and press Return.
   d. Halt and reboot your workstation. Login as root again.
   e. Type mknod /dev/cua1 c 12 128, and press Return.
      Type chmod 666 /dev/cua1, and press Return.
      Type chown uucp /dev/cua1, and press Return.
   f. Type ln /dev/cua1 /dev/cua2, and press Return.
   g. Make a backup copy of /etc/remote, call it /etc/remote2 for example.
   h. Type /usr/ucb/vi /etc/remote and press Return.
      Edit the /etc/remote file as follows, see steps i-k.
   i. While in VI, make a copy of the two-line entry beginning hardwire:\
      and paste the entry just before any of the entries beginning with tip 
      in the /etc/remote file.
      WARNING: Be sure to copy the entry -- do NOT attempt to type in the 
               /etc/remote entry for your modem. It contains some special
               control characters that are difficult to insert with the 
               text editor.
   j. In the new entry, change the word hardwire to modem and change the
      word ttyb to cua1. The result will look like the following:
      -------------------------------------------------------------------
      Before change-
      hardwire:\
              :dv=/dev/ttyb:br#9600:el=^C^S^Q^U^D:ie=%$:oe=^D:
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
      After change-
      modem:\
              :dv=/dev/cua1:br#38400:el=^C^S^Q^U^D:ie=%$:oe=^D:
      --------------------------------------------------------------------
   k. Type :wq! to save the updates in /etc/remote.


   4. Now you can open a shelltool window under OpenWindow and try to dial out.
   WARNING. Do NOT enable scrolling in your shelltool window or use a 
   cmdtool window to dial out, it does not work well with the modem protocol.

   5. Connect to the modem by typing:
       tip modem

   6. To dial out, type: 
      atdt 555-1212

Facilities is conducting an occupancy audit of all Bay area 
buildings.

Please dont be alarmed and do try to be patient as the team walks through.
They may ask you a couple questions:
whats your name?
whats your sunid number? (badge number)

*In some cases they may use the telephone to attempt to identify the 
occupant(s).
They may also need to poke their heads into labs which are on their list
as potentially occupied by people.

*If you have security concerns with this group viewing into labs please make
a note of the names,sunid# of the occupants and tape it on the outside of 
the door.

If you have any questions or concerns regarding this project and its people,
please send email to occupancy@thenest.corp 


Thanks again for your patience

Apologies if this has been answered already, but I can find no record anywhere.
A key customer of ours is interested to just make sure the status (Cray).

As our R6-based server has not been released yet, that's not a problem for
us and will be taken care before release, right?

Also, this is not a problem for our current R5 based server, do I have that
right?

Thanks for any clarification or pointers.

To: cert-advisory@cert.org
Subject: CERT Vendor-Initiated Bulletin VB-95:08 - X Authentication Vul

CERT Vendor-Initiated Bulletin VB-95:08
November 2, 1995

Topic: X Authentication Vulnerability 
Source: X Consortium

To aid in the wide distribution of essential security information, the
CERT Coordination Center is forwarding the following information from
the X Consortium. The X Consortium urges you to act on this
information as soon as possible. X Consortium contact information is
included in the forwarded text below; please contact them if you have
any questions or need further information.


========================FORWARDED TEXT STARTS HERE============================

Two widely used X Window System authorization schemes have weaknesses
in the sample implementation.  These weaknesses could allow
unauthorized remote users to connect to X displays and are present in
X11 Release 6 and earlier releases of the X11 sample implementation.

There are reports that systems have been broken into using at
least one of these weaknesses and that there are now exploit
programs available in the intruder community.


MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 Description:

On systems on which xdm is built without the HasXdmAuth config option,
the MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key generated by xdm may be guessable.

If you use MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 to authenticate X connections, and
your keys are generated by xdm, and xdm does not also support
XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 authentication (that is, your X tree was not
built with the HasXdmAuth config option), you may be at risk.

On systems with poor pseudo-random number generators, the key may be
guessable by remote users.  On other systems, users with access to the
file system where xdm stores its keys for use by local servers may be
able to use information in the file system to guess the key.

If your xdm program was built with HasXdmAuth set to YES (the compiler
command line includes the -DHASXDMAUTH flag), MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 keys
generated by xdm are not vulnerable; the DES code is used to generate
cryptographically secure keys.

Impact

Remote users anywhere on the Internet may be able to connect to your
X display server.  It is NOT necessary that they be able to snoop your
key first.


XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 Description:

The X server does not correctly check the XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 data and
can be fooled into accepting invalid data.

A user who can snoop the encrypted authorization data of a valid
connection can create fake auth data that the X server will accept.

If you do not use XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1, you are not vulnerable.

Determining whether your server is vulnerable: this problem is fixed
in X servers from the X Consortium with a vendor release number of
6001 or higher.

Impact

Remote users may be able to connect to your X display server.



SOLUTIONS

A.  Install a vendor supplied patch if available.

B.  If your site is using X11 built from X Consortium X11R6 sources,
install public patch #13.  This patch is available via anonymous 
FTP from ftp.x.org as the file /pub/R6/fixes/fix-13.  It is also 
available from the many sites that mirror ftp.x.org.  Apply all patches 
not already applied, up to and including fix-13.  The file xc/bug-report
shows what public patches have been already applied to your source
tree.

The MD5 checksum of fix-13 is as follows:

MD5 (fix-13) = 0d81d843acf803a8bedf90d3a18b9ed6

C.  If your site is using an earlier version of the X Consortium's X11,
upgrade to X11R6.  Install all patches up to and including fix-13.

D.  Work arounds.

1.  Building with HasXdmAuth will eliminate the first vulnerability.
The necessary DES code is available for FTP from both inside the
US (for US sites only) and outside (for non-US sites).  Read
<ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/R6/xdm-auth/README> for details on obtaining
this code.

2.  If you cannot use DES, you can determine your exposure to
remote attackers by testing the strength of your rand() function
using the program rand-test; the source is available as
<ftp://ftp.x.org/pub/DOCS/rand-test/rand-test.c>.

3.  Limiting use of X connections using XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1 to trusted
networks will prevent unauthorized parties from snooping X protocol
traffic, thus preventing exploitation of the second vulnerability.


Acknowledgements: The X Consortium would like to thank Chris Hall of
the University of Colorado for analyzing these problems and bringing
them to our attention.

                          Vendor Status

The following information was supplied by vendors for this bulletin.
The X Consortium and CERT have not verified this information.


Cray Research

UNICOS 8.0 and 9.0 are not vulnerable.  These systems have robust 
pseudo-random number generators, making them not vulnerable to the
first problem, and do not support an X server, making them not
vulnerable to the second problem.


GSSC (formerly Solbourne)

Has concluded they are not vulnerable.


Hewlett-Packard

All versions of X on HP-UX 9.x and 10.x (based on X11R5) do not
have the first vulnerability.


X Consortium

(Sample implementation of X.)  You can patch X11R6 by applying all
public patches up to and including fix-13.  Patches are available
via FTP from ftp.x.org in /pub/R6/fixes/ and from mirroring sites.

You can check that the X server has fix-13 installed by verifying
that the server has a vendor release number of 6001 or higher.

General questions about the X Window System can be asked on the
xpert mailing list hosted at x.org.  Send a "subscribe" message to
xpert-request@x.org to subscribe.  This list is gatewayed with
the comp.windows.x newsgroup.  The FAQ for this newsgroup is
available from <ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/faqs/FAQ.Z> and other
locations.  <http://www.x.org/consortium/news_and_mail.html>
describes other newsgroups and mailing lists for the discussion
of issues related to the X Window System.

Bugs encounted in X Consortium code can be reported to
xbugs@x.org using the format in xc/bug-report.  Please see the
X11R6 Release Notes for additional details.

Hi everyone!

I am just writing to let you all know that I will be gone for awhile.
I am going to be filling in for my friend in Menlo Park 14 who, for
health reasons, needs me to take over her lobby temporarily.
Meanwhile, another receptionist will be filling in for me.  I will be
coming back to MTV21 sometime in the next few months, but I just wanted
you all to know that I am REALLY going to miss it here while I am gone;
it is such a pleasure to work with all of you every day.  I will look
forward to coming back.  If you are ever in Menlo Park, stop by
building 14 if you get the chance and say hi!  Take care, and I hope
that you all have happy holidays!

Sincerely,

Sheila Speiser, lobby receptionist

Hi Folks:

I will be doing a supply order next week, please let me know if you need
any office supplies or if you need to know where to look for something.
There is a Corporate Express and a Kalleens catalogue at my desk.
Please write down what you want to be ordered and your name.
I'll leave a list with the catalogues. Or send me e-mail.


Thanks,

Linda

Hi Micky,

Dave mentioned that the latest compilers can be found under:

  /net/xsun3/export/space8/SC4.0/

I just noticed that they don't seem to be as recent as those under
/net/dprelease :

568 kontiki%> /net/xsun3/export/space8/SC4.0/bin/cc -V
cc: SC4.0 27 Sep 1995 C 4.0

It's not a big deal - just wondered if you were aware they don't appear
to be the latest.

Hi Kevin, Lee,

Dave asked me to investigate the 4.0 C compiler switches you mentioned
are used in the kernel to see if we might employ them to improve
performance in CDE apps:

> -xO3 -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 -xregs=no%appl -xspace -W0,-Lt -Xt

-Wa,-cg92 just passes '-cg92' to the assembler.  This option doesn't
appear to be supported by the assembler (fbe) and seems to be a noop.

-W0,-Lt passes the -Lt option to the compiler (acomp and ssbd).  I've no
idea what this does.  How does one find out the available options to
each of the compilation modules?

-Xt is just ANSI "transition" mode ; I wouldn't think it has any direct
bearing on performance.  In fact, we should probably compile -Xc (full
ANSI conformance) wherever possible.

Why is the kernel using -xregs=no%appl - the man-page states that it
disallows using the registers g2, g3 and g4.  I would have thought that
juggling data between fewer registers would hinder performance.


-xspace and -xO3 appear to somewhat contradict each other :

-xO3 does loop unrolling and pipelining, resulting in larger code.
-xspace prevents size increases and avoids loop unrolling.

Is the combination of these options a no-op, or is there some other
benefit from using these options together?  What is "pipelining"?  Is
the net effect to suppress loop unrolling but enable pipelining?


-xcg89 seems to optimize for the lowest common denominator; it's
equivalent to:

          =xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1.

Surely, each kernel is built for a _specific_ architecture; why is this
done?

Wouldn't the default -xchip=generic (Use timing properties for good
performance on most SPARCs.) be a good choice, or does this fail to
produce working code on older architectures?

Same question for -xarch=generic and -xcache=generic .

Thanks for any information,

    --- John.

Agenda From Previous Week:

o  Get more involved with the dtmail re-architecture.

o  In libXm.so, TextF.c and TextOut.c appear to have duplicate
   occurrences of some large, (almost) identical functions.  Investigate
   if they can be factored into one instance.

o  Find out more about Kevin Clarke's "mega" library ideas.

o  Continue looking into dtwm performance.  Initial tests indicate it
   uses a very large amount of heap during startup.

This Week:

o  Filed the following bugs:

      1228787: Some dtcm code cleanup will improve performance

o  Talked to Kevin Clarke about his ideas for a huge CDE library.

   The idea was to create a single large library and use the ld filter
   technology to make the current CDE libraries filters onto the large
   library.  Then we could scope away more global symbols.  However,
   there would also be some additional cost due to the need to relocate
   additional data symbols for apps that would ordinarily only use a
   subset of the libraries.  It turns out that the only 2 libraries we
   could usefully merge would be libDtSvc and libDtWidget, which overall
   makes it probably not worth the effort, especially since parts of
   DtWidget will hopefully become obsolete when we eventually move to
   Motif 2.0.

o  Read up on ld filters from the llm WEB page:
   Check out: /net/bondage/disk4/linkers/llm/index.html

o  Discovered that the following Motif functions exist in both TextF.o
   and TextOut.o The number to the right is the function's byte size:

XmSetNormGC     192		MakeAddModeCursor     684    
XmSetMarginGC   92		LoadGCs      672             
XmSetInvGC     120		LoadFontMetrics     696      
XmSetFullGC     168		InvertImageGC     168        
XmResetSaveGC     104		HandleTimer     156          
TryResize     148		GetRect      232             
PaintCursor     836		GetClipMask     264          
MakeIBeamStencil     944	CurrentCursorState     104   
MakeIBeamOffArea     236	CheckHasRect      68         
MakeCursors     432		BlinkInsertionPoint     136  

Yuck!  Unfortunately, the functions are slightly different in that one
operates on Text widgets and the other operates on TextField widgets;
owing to the subtle differences between the Text and TextField widget
implementations, it appears to be non-trivial to merge the functions.
The duplication also exists in Motif 2.0.  I've informed the Motif group
about this.

o  Spoke with Gary Gere and Greg Layer about dtmail - the back end will
   provide a single module that handles all threading and will also
   provide synchronous and asynchronous APIs for certain operations.
   The front-end will be incrementally modified to use the asynchronous
   calls where appropriate.

o  Obtained and studied the latest dtmail architecture document.

o  Contacted Jim Kimble in the nsl group to try to understand more about
   the large allocations in dtcm owing to its libnsl usage.

o  Noticed that Motif 2.0 no longer caches Atoms internally, but just
   uses Xlib's atom caching.  Did a little investigation into the size
   of Motif 2.0 vs (Motif 1.2 + DtWidget), since in Motif 2.0, we can
   remove DtWidget from some apps.  Also, "plain" Motif apps that just
   need a combo box would no longer bring in DtWidget which in turn
   brings in DtSvc which in turn brings in tooltalk - quite a price for
   a ComboBox!

o  Obtained some mspy data from dtwm startup.  Still need to further
   analyze this.

o  Started initial investigation into the possible benefits of using
   some of the 4.0 C compiler switches that are used to build the
   kernel.


Next Week:

o  Follow up with Gary Gere on the dtmail architecture.

o  Meet with Jim Kimble to discuss the large libnsl allocations.

o  Continue investigation into 4.0 C compiler switches.

o  Continue dtwm startup analysis.

Status for Dawn Wallner on KCMS

Plan and Results 
----------------
**Family here so I will probably only come in for a while to handle
anything that may have come up..
	Dropped in a couple times the week of Thanskgiving - took
	the days before off and Monday after.

**Work on the calibrator drivers for the PPC and hopefully fix them so
they can be compiled optimized and work.
	Spent a long time on trying to get purify linked into
	the calibrator - finally did, but it didn't seem to help
	find the problem.  While desperately trying to debug optimized
	code, I put a fprintf statement in one place that magically
	alowed everything to work.  Scary - but works.  Don't know 
	yet if I'm trouncing on memory or if it is a ppc compiler
	problem.  This works temporarily.

**Ping X-Rite to see if they are making progress on setting up their
Solaris demo machine.
	They have received the kcms packages - no desperate calls yet.

**Try again for someone to help Barco in Europe.
	Next week.

**Attempt to get started on either color conversion profiles or MT safe
KCMS for 2.6.  Contact Doug Walker through George at Kodak - he offered to 
tutor me on creating color conversion profiles, if he can get the OK.
	Not yet.

**Other stuff
	A strange initial install bug came up again that I thought was
	surely fixed in 12- I have not been able to recreate it here.  It 
	came up late enough in the week that, after several discussions,
	I decided to put back the script-based OWconfig update method
	which worked just fine up to the change for build 12.  I will
	now wait to make any changes in OWconfig updating methods until 2.6.

	Bug came in on L10N message file location for X-rite.  After 
	a lot of messing around to try to test it out, it's fixed - it
	was a path including lib misprinted as bin - argh.

	Gathered together the info I received on what XGL, XIL, and KCMS
	would like to put on a web page and sent it off to Mark Eades and
	a contact he has.  marketing is evidently hiring the Markham (sp)
	group to design the web pages for us.

	Received the printer results from Rich Berlin to test out the
	new printer profile - there are strange stripes in the prints -
	he will redo them for me since Kodak would like to see them along
	with the orginal photographs for comparison.

	Since 2.5.1 beta was slipped and I had bugs to fix, I tested
	and delivered build 14 beta for sparc, x86 and ppc.

	Built and delivered SDK beta for 2.5.1 for sparc, x86 and ppc.
	Delivered SRC_RTC for upcoming source beta.

	Sent off complete set of 2.5 cd's to Kodak. Sent a test suite
	code fix that Dave found on pulsar off to Kodak.
	Gathered info for Kodak on where to find multi-thread documents,
	multi-thread classes, talked to them about joint effort work and
	it looks like the thing that makes ense is MT safe work.  They
	should now be able to get the named color work done before
	feature freeze since it looks like it will be May.

Next Week
---------
Test and deliver source product for the three architectures - provide 
build logs - clear and sccs versions.

Try again for someone to help Barco in Europe.

Get new prints to Kodak.

Attempt to get started on either color conversion profiles or MT safe
KCMS for 2.6.  Contact Doug Walker through George at Kodak - he offered to 
tutor me on creating color conversion profiles, if he can get the OK.

I just spoke to Peter on the phone.

He seems to have very little knowledge of Motif, given away in part by
his comment "The widgets are the resources, right?"

He really has no idea about widgets, confusing them with C++ classes
(the Doug Young C++ wrappers).

I asked him a little about C++ and found he also doesn't understand
virtual functions.

Furthermore, I thought he didn't communicate very well; at least I found
his explanations difficult to follow.

He expressed some interest in threading and claims to have done thread
work on other platforms, but I didn't ask him much in this area.

Overall, I don't feel he has the appropriate experience.

*** Status for Ed Goei ending 1dec95

Issues / RedFlags:
    + ARC review for libim got moved up: Inception review is Dec 18,
	Commitment review is Jan 8.

Old Plan:
    + Run 1.3 version of Xilch on Extrema and SqueezeRange and putback
	the code.

    + Make time estimates for action items from the code review.

    + Start work on histogram or error_diffusion routine.

Results:
    + Putback code for Extrema and SqueezeRange.

    + Worked on some action items from code review.

    + The LSARC reviews for libim (Instamatic I/O library) have been
	moved up so I have been busy preparing for the first review.
	The Inception review is Monday, Dec 18 and I need to finish
	writing various documents at least a week before that date so
	the reviewers can look at them before the meeting.

New Plan:
    + Finish the GPI document for libim.  Finish the 20Questions for
	LSARC.  Update C API for libim.  Send out material to LSARC
	reviewers.  Follow up on various unanswered issues, like where
	the library will be installed.

    + Work on histogram and error_diffusion.

John, please send your questions to nbe@road, these are the backend
engineers who can explain in detail the questions you have asked.

  --> From jsc@kontiki Fri Dec  1 16:38:24 1995
  --> From: jsc@kontiki (John S Cooper)
  --> To: kjc@kontiki, lee.bieber@kontiki
  --> CC: jsc@kontiki
  --> Subject: 4.0 Compiler switches and performance
  --> X-Attribution: JSC
  --> 
  --> Hi Kevin, Lee,
  --> 
  --> Dave asked me to investigate the 4.0 C compiler switches you mentioned
  --> are used in the kernel to see if we might employ them to improve
  --> performance in CDE apps:
  --> 
  --> > -xO3 -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 -xregs=no%appl -xspace -W0,-Lt -Xt
  --> 
  --> -Wa,-cg92 just passes '-cg92' to the assembler.  This option doesn't
  --> appear to be supported by the assembler (fbe) and seems to be a noop.
  --> 
  --> -W0,-Lt passes the -Lt option to the compiler (acomp and ssbd).  I've no
  --> idea what this does.  How does one find out the available options to
  --> each of the compilation modules?
  --> 
  --> -Xt is just ANSI "transition" mode ; I wouldn't think it has any direct
  --> bearing on performance.  In fact, we should probably compile -Xc (full
  --> ANSI conformance) wherever possible.
  --> 
  --> Why is the kernel using -xregs=no%appl - the man-page states that it
  --> disallows using the registers g2, g3 and g4.  I would have thought that
  --> juggling data between fewer registers would hinder performance.
  --> 
  --> 
  --> -xspace and -xO3 appear to somewhat contradict each other :
  --> 
  --> -xO3 does loop unrolling and pipelining, resulting in larger code.
  --> -xspace prevents size increases and avoids loop unrolling.
  --> 
  --> Is the combination of these options a no-op, or is there some other
  --> benefit from using these options together?  What is "pipelining"?  Is
  --> the net effect to suppress loop unrolling but enable pipelining?
  --> 
  --> 
  --> -xcg89 seems to optimize for the lowest common denominator; it's
  --> equivalent to:
  --> 
  -->           =xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1.
  --> 
  --> Surely, each kernel is built for a _specific_ architecture; why is this
  --> done?
  --> 
  --> Wouldn't the default -xchip=generic (Use timing properties for good
  --> performance on most SPARCs.) be a good choice, or does this fail to
  --> produce working code on older architectures?
  --> 
  --> Same question for -xarch=generic and -xcache=generic .
  --> 
  --> Thanks for any information,
  --> 
  -->     --- John.

IMPORTANT:  IF YOU PARTICIPATED IN THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN(S), PLEASE
	    READ THIS E-MAIL, AS THESE IMPORTANT DEADLINES MAY EFFECT
	    YOUR 1995 W-2.


ESPP AND STOCK OPTION EXERCISE/SALE DEADLINES
---------------------------------------------
       
            ESPP          - FRIDAY, DECEMBER 15, 1995
            STOCK OPTIONS - TUESDAY, DECEMBER 19, 1995
  
In anticipation of year-end related deadlines and Sun's winter break
schedule, the reporting deadline for Employee Stock Purchase Plan
("ESPP") sales in calendar year 1995 will be FRIDAY, December 15,
1995.  The reporting deadline for exercises/sales of vested stock
option shares in calendar year 1995 will be TUESDAY, December 19,
1995.  If you wish to exercise shares this calendar year, please
contact Susan McGowan for assistance (susan.mcgowan@Corp, ext.  66862.)

In summary, 

     ESPP sales 1/1/95 through 12/15/95 = W-2.
     ESPP sales 12/16/95 through 12/31/95 = W-2C.

     stock option exercises/sales 1/1/95 through 12/19/95 = W2.  
     stock option exercises/sales 12/20/95 through 12/31/95 = W-2C.

ANY ADJUSTMENTS RECEIVED AFTER THE DEADLINES WILL RESULT IN AN AMENDED
W-2 (W-2C).  The turn around for these late adjustments will be a
"minimum" of eight weeks once Stock Plan Administration ("SPA") has
submitted the update to the Payroll Department.


INCOME REPORTING 
----------------

The three types of Sun stock transactions which create a W-2 income
reporting responsibility for Sun are as follows:

   1)  a sale of ESPP shares occurring within two years of your date of
       enrollment into the ESPP OR within one year of your date of
       purchase.

   2)  the exercise of a Non-Statutory Stock Option (NSO).

   3)  vesting in shares purchased under the Restricted Stock Plan.

Notifications of tax withholding and income recognition related to
exercises of NSOs and vesting in shares of Restricted stock are
processed by Payroll soon after your transactions occur.  For your
records, a confirmation check stub is generated immediately following
Payroll's processing of these items.

Please note that: 

   o   WITHHOLDING AMOUNTS collected by SPA are included in the
       year-to-date tax fields on your check stub for the remainder of
       the year.

   o   INCOME related to these types of transactions does not appear in
       the year-to-date income field for the remainder of the year.

   o   BOTH will appear in the totals reported on your W-2.

A Year-End Stock Option Tax Summary will be mailed to you from SPA
which will include transactions through the end of the calendar year in
mid-January, 1996.  This will be mailed to the name and address as
indicated on your paystub.  If you need to make a name or address
correction, please do so in AutoBen no later than December 8th.  If you
do not have access to AutoBen, please contact your HR person or your
Benefits Site person for a Personal Data Form.

Income related to sales of ESPP shares is reported to Payroll by SPA in
mid-December.  You will receive a supplemental check stub labeled
"ESPP" in mid-December confirming the amount of ESPP related income, if
any, being reported by Sun on your W-2 for calendar year 1995.
However, for most employees, the amount appearing on the supplemental
check stub will simply correspond with the amount appearing on the ESPP
Certificate History Statement in AutoBen.  You should be able to print
your statement from your workstation.  If you are not able to, please
contact your system administrator for assistance.

The AutoBen update schedule is as follows:

ESPP TRANSACTIONS REPORTED BY . . .      WILL BE AVAILABLE BY . . .

      November 30, 1995                        December 7, 1995
      December 15, 1995                        December 21, 1995
      December 31, 1995                        January 11, 1996 

Income related to sales or other transactions recorded by SPA after the
the December 15 and 19, 1995, cutoff dates will be reported to and
processed by Payroll for inclusion in the original W-2 by way of W-2C.
This will include sales of ESPP shares executed the last few days of
the year through Smith Barney's Employee Stock Investment Plan
("EMSIP") Department in New York or same-day sales of stock option
shares executed through either the Alex. Brown office in San Francisco,
CA or the Smith Barney offices located in Palo Alto, CA or Toms River,
NJ.

PLEASE REVIEW YOUR ESPP HISTORY STATEMENT ON AUTOBEN.  If you have
any additional ESPP sales or corrections to report, please do so by
e-mailing the information to our processing account, esppsale@Corp.

NOTE:  Processing of W-2Cs will take a "minimum" of eight weeks from
       the date SPA reports any additional sales or changes (submitted
       after the December 15th and 19th deadline) to the Payroll
       Department.

If you need assistance understanding SPA's reporting of income related
to your Sun stock transactions (including how income amounts are
calculated and how to read your ESPP History Statement), please refer to
Helios (type "helios" at a system prompt, enter the Employee Handbook,
Compensation and Benefits, Stock Plan Administration section).  You may
also contact Susan McGowan for assistance (x66862, susan.mcgowan@Corp)
or myself (x65678, judy.wrightphillips@Corp).

Sun strongly recommends that you contact your personal tax advisor or
financial planner to fully understand the tax consequences associated
with your Sun stock transactions.

Re:	SPG Marketing Structure


There have been some changes in the SPG marketing structure recently,
and I wanted to summarize the organization for FY96.

Janpieter's staff has agreed that product drivers, channel drivers and
field training people will report to the SunSoft field organization.  In
support of this decision the Solaris product driver group headed by 
Klaus Hoffman has been transferred to SunSoft WWFO.  In addition,
Janpieter's staff has agreed that marcom and PR will be coordinated
across all SunSoft by a Corporate Marketing group headed by a VP to
be hired.  In support of this decision the Solaris marcom group will
move to the corporate marketing group when the VP is hired.

Michael Sears has decided to pursue other opportunities within Sun,
and thus will assume a role contributing to SunSoft executive 
staff for special projects. I'd like to thank Michael for the job 
he has done in SPG, for both Janpieter and me, first building a
top class marketing organization almost from scratch, and then leading
that group forward as we introduced the Solaris Server Suites, Base 
Server and Solaris 2.5. Please wish Michael luck on his new assignment.

Dave Spenhoff continues as Director, Solaris Product Marketing now
reporting to me. In this role, Dave will be responsible for market 
requirements, product positioning, pricing, and promotion of all Solaris
products (including IUS) on Sparc, Intel and PowerPC platforms.  Dave's 
group is the primary interface with SunSoft Corporate Marketing and WWFO.

Ann Wettersten continues as Director, Solaris Technology Strategy reporting
to me.  Ann's group develops technology roadmaps and technology investment 
strategies, evangelizes Solaris technology to customers and analysts, and 
works with technology providers to bring complementary technologies into
SunSoft. Ann's group is the primary interface with development engineering. 

Please support Ann and Dave as they move forward with the Solaris Marketing
program for the future.  FY96 is full of challenges for us, but our products
are stronger than they have ever been, and opportunities abound, and this
marketing team can help us sieze those opportunities.

I. THE IECG FAMILY -- 2200 MEMBERS IN 65 COUNTRIES!

International email correspondence chess history was made on
2 November 1995, 15:00 GMT when Douglas D. Eckert (USA) registered
as IECG's 2000th member!

The pace of increase in IECG membership during the past 14 months has
been nothing short of astounding! From 800 or so members in 39 countries
in October 1994, IECG has now reached 2200 members in 65 countries! This
translates into increased (and more varied) playing opportunities for
each and every member!

In November IECG continued to attract new members. Some 267 new members
registered with IECG in November for an average of nearly 9 players per
day. Total IECG membership as of 30 November 1995, stands at 2218 members.

Let's keep the momentum going! Tell your chessplaying friends and
acquaintances about the benefits of IECG membership!


II. ICCF EMBRACES THE FUTURE: ANNOUNCING TWO ICCF EMAIL CHESS TOURNAMENTS!

ICCF (International Correspondence Chess Federation) is pleased to announce
two ongoing international email tournaments, which will start on 1 January
1996 and will be run in collaboration with IECG (International Email Chess
Group). The entry fee in either tournament will be the equivalent of
approximately 10 Swiss Francs (CHF) per section.

=====  o   o  =====
    o / \ / \ o        For players of Master-class strength (ELO 2100) and
     \ - - - /         above, there will be a three-stage promotion-style
      =======          tournament culminating in the *ICCF Email Champion-
      I C C F          ship*!
      -------
    AMICI SUMUS        For players below Master-class strength, there will be
* We are friends! *    a three-stage cup-style tournament with *cash prizes*!
===================

EMAIL CHAMPIONSHIP

Players of master class level or above (guideline: FIDE or ICCF 2100+)
are invited to play in this event, which is run in three stages.

The first stage consists of master class sections with 7 or 15 players.
To qualify for the next level a player needs one full qualification
(first place in a 15-player section) or two half-qualifications (first
place in a 7-player section or second place in a 15-player section).

The second stage consists of Candidates tournaments with 15 players.
To qualify for the next level a player needs just one first or second
place finish.

The third stage is the *ICCF Email Championship*, again of 15 players.
It is likely that successful players in this will gain an ICCF title
(e.g. International Correspondence Chess Master).

It is the intention to include this event in due course in the main ICCF
rating system.


EMAIL CUP

This event, for players not eligible for the event outlined above, is
also run in three stages.

The first stage is preliminary sections of 7 players, with the first two
proceeding to the second stage.

The second stage is semi-final sections of 9 players, with the first
two players proceeding to the final.

Each final has 11 players, and any player scoring scoring 5 points or
more will qualify for the master level event. There will be cash prizes
of 400, 200 and 100 CHF for the first three players in each final (paid
in local currency!).


GENERAL COMMENTS

In all stages of both events, players play one game by email against
each opponents, with a time allowance of 40 days per 10 moves.

Sections in both tournaments will be started continuously as soon as
enough entries are received to give an acceptable geographic mix.

All games will be included in the ICCF/IECG Email rating system.

IV. ANNALS OF AN IECG TOURNAMENT SECRETARY: INCREDIBLE BUT TRUE!

Recently, IECG had the pleasure of welcoming veteran Master-class
correspondence player Timothy Sawyer as an IECG member. Tim has competed
in ICCF Master-class events for a number of years, and in 1982-84 he
played Board 4 for the US team in the ICCF 10th Olympiad. He has played
about 900 (!) correspondence games, of which several have been by
e-mail, and has published two chess books, the "Blackmar-Diemer Gambit
Keybook" (1992) and the "Alapin French" (1995).

After receiving his pairing for IECG Class M/Exp 2-game match no. 5668,
Tim sent in the following note:

    "International Email Chess Group: Franz Hemmer TD
     -----------------------------------------------------------
     Match No: 5668   2-Game Match      Class: M/Exp      Pace: ???

             White                              Black
     Game 1: Timothy E. Sawyer                - Tom Purser
     Game 2: Tom Purser                       - Timothy E. Sawyer

     -----

     Was this a random pairing?  Are you kidding me?

     Last night I am thinking to myself, I will enter an IECG event and
     play the Blackmar-Diemer Gambit. I will probably crush some master
     who does not know the BDG well and who does not know the Lemberger
     variation at all. And I have several thousand Blackmar-Diemer Gambit
     (BDG) games in my database. I wrote the book on the BDG, and I write
     articles for the BDG World magazine. The publisher of that magazine
     is the ONLY PLAYER IN THE WORLD who knows the BDG better than I do
     and who has a larger database than I. He is an expert in the
     Lemberger variation. We correspond frequently and share games and
     analysis every few days. Who is he? Tom Purser.

     OK, I WILL PLAY Tom Purser. But I was really hoping to play somebody
     else, ANYBODY ELSE! I had no idea that Tom was entering IECG. With
     2000 players, what are the odds of meeting him? We did play an APCT
     (American Postal Chess Tournaments) rated e-mail match six months ago
     and we split 1-1."

     -- Tim Sawyer (USA)

What an incredible coincidence, Tim! Let me assure you that the only
criteria for pairings for 2-game matches are *rating class* and
*availability*. Think of this match as an opportunity to add to your
database! :)

                                                             -- Henk Chang

[Ed. note: After Blackmar-Diemer expert Tom Purser came across an IECG
announcement in rec.games.chess.play-by-email under my signature, he wrote
in to ask if I was *that* Don Odom who had served as Treasurer and
Newsletter Editor for the European Chess District (ECD) of the US Chess
Federation (USCF) in 1980-81 when Tom was ECD President. Well, I am guilty
as charged and, thanks to IECG and the marvels of rgc.pbem, Tom and I have
have been able to 're-strike up' our friendship. Welcome to IECG, Tom, and
'Good skill' to you your games, Blackmar-Diemer and otherwise!]


V. MATS LARSSON APPOINTED AS IECG SENIOR ADJUDICATOR

IECG Advisor on Master Events and Tournament Secretary Mats Larsson

IX. NEW AUTOMATED ROUTINES FOR IMPROVED IECG MEMBER SERVICES!

The explosive growth in IECG membership (currently at 2200 in 65 countries!)
has placed increased demands on IECG systems and routines.

To maintain the high level of service enjoyed by each and every IECG member,
the IECG staff is pleased to announce that members are now able to register
for new 2-game matches and class tournament sections *automatically*!

HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS ...

1.  Each player will receive - in a separate email message - a
    unique 6-digit membership number, for personal and private use.
    This unique number is key element which provides the member
    access to the services offered by the automated system.

    Access to the functions supported is provided by typing correctly
    the particular command in the email message block according to
    the set format (see examples below).

2.  As noted above, in the beginning two commands are supported:

    TWO-GAME-MATCH * This command will request the start of a new 2-game
    match. Please note that this is an 'additive' command. Using it
    multiple times in the same email message will result in initiating
    that number of new 2-game matches.

    CLASS-TOURNAMENT * This command is used to register for a new section
    in a class tournament. Please note that this is an 'additive' command.

3.  To use the automated system, you must send your email message only to
    <iecg@cc.UManitoba.CA>

    You must also follow the prescribed format for the body of email
    message. Please note that there may be no blank lines within the
    command message. Please note that commands are given only in
    UPPERCASE letters.

    BEGIN IECG-KEY <6-digit member_id number. Do not include these brackets!>
    COMMAND
    END

4.  Please note that all other text in email is ignored by the system.
    Any additional information/comments should be sent in a separate email
    message.

SOME PRACTICAL EXAMPLES ...

An example of a player with IECG membership number 500000, requesting the
start of a new two-game match follows:

    BEGIN IECG-KEY 500000
    TWO-GAME-MATCH
    END

It's as simple as that!

Here's another example of a player with IECG membership number 600000,
requesting entry into a new class tournament section:

    BEGIN IECG-KEY 600000
    CLASS-TOURNAMENT
    END

Again, it's as simple as that!


IMPROVED SERVICE FOR IECG MEMBERS IS THE GOAL!

It goes without saying that the goal of the new automated system is to
provide improved service for each and every IECG member.

Other commands will eventually be supported and new features added as the
automated system is expanded and improved.

If you have any questions concerning the automated system, please address
them to either Henk Chang <iecg@cc.UManitoba.CA> or Don Odom
<editor@forestedt.se>


X. ROUTINES FOR OTHER MEMBER COMMUNICATION AND SERVICES

To insure quick and efficient communication with each member, please
review the checklist below for communicating with the IECG staff.

REQUESTS FOR ENTRY INTO NEW 2-GAME MATCHES AND CLASS TOURNAMENT SECTIONS:
Please use the new automated IECG system for requesting new 2-game matches
and class tournament sections described above (see section IX).

REQUESTS FOR ENTRY INTO NEW QUAD SECTIONS:  Please continue to send all
requests for entry into new Quad sections to TD for Quads Richard Kyllo
<rkyllo@mts.net>

REPORTING GAME RESULTS: Please report your game and match results,
including complete gamescores to the TD or TS for your event. Remember
that your result is not posted until a complete game score is received by
the TD or TS!

CLAIMS REQUIRING ARBITRATION: All claims requiring arbitration should be
sent to IECG VP Arbitration Robert Fischer <rfischer@omni.voicenet.com>

ALL OTHER COMMUNICATION: Please send all other communications to Henk Chang
<iecg@cc.UManitoba.CA> This includes specific problems/situations not
covered by the above.

As noted above, *all* requests for entry into additional 2-game matches
or class or other tournaments should be sent *only* to Henk Chang
<iecg@cc.UManitoba.CA>


XI. INTERNET CHESS SERVERS: ANOTHER FORM OF *CORRESPONDENCE* CHESS?

At the ICCF Congress in Gjovik, your Bulletin editor was pleased to accept
appointment to the ICCF New Technologies Working Group (NTWG). The
principal goal of the NTWG is to collect information about the impact of
new technologies for move transmission, primarily telefax and email, on
correspondence chess and to report its findings to the ICCF Congress in
Bad Nauerheim, Germany, in August 1996.

The NTWG has continued its work at a brisk pace since the Congress,
finalizing preparations for an initial package of ICCF email tournaments
to be offered in cooperation with the IECG beginning in January 1996 (see
above). Also confirmed were a set of preliminary rules for email play in
ICCF email tournaments.

With the rapid and dramatic introduction of new technologies,
correspondence chess must also be prepared to adapt with equal speed and
drama. Today, accepted methods of move transmission in international
correspondence chess include traditional postal means, facsimile (fax) and
electronic mail (email).

However, what about other forms of move transmission based on new Internet
and telecommunications technologies, such as 'real-time' blitz games
played on one of the various Internet Chess Servers (ICS) and games played
via home pages or through video conferencing? Should 'blitz' games played
on ICS, games played via home pages or games played via video conferencing
be regarded as 'correspondence' chess?

ICCF, the recognized governing body for international correspondence
chess, provides the following definition of its activities and of
correspondence chess: "... The International Correspondence Chess
Federation (ICCF) is the worldwide organisation for correspondence chess
(which is a game of chess in which moves are delivered by post or any
other form of transmission). The aims of ICCF are to organise, develop and
promote the study and practice of international correspondence chess
throughout the world."

Thus, according to the official definition above, correspondence chess is
simply *any* form of chess *other* than that which is practiced by two
people physically present at the same board. This includes games played on
ICS, via home pages or through video conferencing, or perhaps through some
future technology that we cannot envisage at the present time.

What is the role of various new technologies in the practice of
correspondence chess and what will be the impact of them on the future of
correspondence chess? What steps must chess organizations take in order to
remain relevant in the wake of these technological innovations and
developments? You are invited to send your views on the above questions in
a cybernote to <editor@forestedt.se> The contributions received will be
compiled and presented in a future article.

In your cybernotes, please specify which technologies/media - you employ
in playing correspondence chess - i.e,, traditional postal, fax, email,
ICS, video conferencing, etc.

Below is a "correspondence" game played on the German Internet Chess
Server (GICS) against the master-strength program "Doppelkeks" running on
an Hewlett-Packard (HP) Apollo, based at the faculty of Civil Engineering
at the University of Kaiserslautern, which hosts the German Internet Chess
Server <chess.unix-ag.uni-kl.de 5000> The time in brackets reflects the
amount of time spent on a particular move.

The following game was played in an IECG experimental section, which is
part of an attempt to verify - under controlled conditions - the actual
strength of computers in correspondence play. The computer was operated by
Franz Hemmer.

to Franz Hemmer for his service and to the IECG as a whole for hitting the
big 2000!                                         - Seth Howard Perlman (USA)

I am surprised about your organization, you have everything perfectly
planned! You are doing very well!                       - Mario Velasco (MEX)

Impressed by the organization!                             - Tom Purser (USA)

The newsletters are really getting "classy". You troups are doing a great
job, keep up the good work.                          - Victor Ouellette (USA)

I think you are a great organization and I'm especially impressed about the
way you introduce people to e-mail chess playing! Continue your great efforts!
                                                         - Stefan Printz (SWE)

I really think that this kind of chess challenge is really motivating ... I
congratulate all of you because I think that you are really well organized
... Greetings and congratulations ... Don't stop!
                                               - Daniel Xavier Rei Duque (POR)

I am impressed! You are prompt and very organised. You also seem to have a
good grasp of what is important and necessary and what is not.
                                            -  Allister Richard Metcalfe (RSA)

I have found your staff and members to have nothing but real class and great
patience and I will and already have recomended IECG to my friends!!!!!! Keep
up the good work and I for one look forward to playing and making many more
friends along the way.                                -  Robert DeSimone (USA)

Please continue to let us know how IECG is doing. Your views and suggestions
are vitally important!

I have a couple of questions about the 4.0 compiler switches - Lee
Bieber mentioned I should direct them to this alias.

 
 Dave asked me to investigate the 4.0 C compiler switches you mentioned
 are used in the kernel to see if we might employ them to improve
 performance in CDE apps:
 
 > -xO3 -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 -xregs=no%appl -xspace -W0,-Lt -Xt
 
 -Wa,-cg92 just passes '-cg92' to the assembler.  This option doesn't
 appear to be supported by the assembler (fbe) and seems to be a noop.
 
 -W0,-Lt passes the -Lt option to the compiler (acomp and ssbd).  I've no
 idea what this does.  How does one find out the available options to
 each of the compilation modules?
 
 -Xt is just ANSI "transition" mode ; I wouldn't think it has any direct
 bearing on performance.  In fact, we should probably compile -Xc (full
 ANSI conformance) wherever possible.
 
 Why is the kernel using -xregs=no%appl - the man-page states that it
 disallows using the registers g2, g3 and g4.  I would have thought that
 juggling data between fewer registers would hinder performance.
 
 
 -xspace and -xO3 appear to somewhat contradict each other :
 
 -xO3 does loop unrolling and pipelining, resulting in larger code.
 -xspace prevents size increases and avoids loop unrolling.
 
 Is the combination of these options a no-op, or is there some other
 benefit from using these options together?  What is "pipelining"?  Is
 the net effect to suppress loop unrolling but enable pipelining?
 
 
 -xcg89 seems to optimize for the lowest common denominator; it's
 equivalent to:
 
           =xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1.
 
 Surely, each kernel is built for a _specific_ architecture; why is this
 done?
 
 Wouldn't the default -xchip=generic (Use timing properties for good
 performance on most SPARCs.) be a good choice, or does this fail to
 produce working code on older architectures?
 
 Same question for -xarch=generic and -xcache=generic .
 
 Thanks for any information,
 
     --- John.

That was a hack for the SC2.0.1 compilers.
It is a nop for SC3.0 and beyond.

I have no idea on this one.

It may be that there is still quite a bit of pre-ANSI C code in the kernel.
Certainly "-Xc" ensures more portability, but it depends on your code
whether it generates correct code (or even compiles).

This is a SPARC ABI issue.  Neither the kernel nor any libraries
that might be linked into an application may use registers %g2-%g4.

The "-xO3" level of optimization does more analysis and more optimization.
The "-xspace" does turn off or limit some of the optimizations
at "-xO3", but you should still get better code with "-xO3 -xspace"
than with "-xO2" or "-O" (at some cost in compile time).
One important difference is the assumption at "-xO2" that
all globals are volatile, thus prohibiting many optimizations.

As far as I know, there is only one version of the kernel for Solaris 2.0-2.4.
However, in Solaris 2.5 and beyond, this may be less true.

Yes, it would probably be better to use the generic options
(note that they are the default).
The "-cg89" is another relic from older compilers (i.e. SC2.0.1).
However, I don't think there is currently much, if any, difference
between "-cg89" and the generic options currently.

      Does anyone have a bugtraq mode that allows one to display, edit and
      create bug reports?

      Thanks,
      -- 

   I believe they deactivated sendbug quite some time ago.  
   I use the following (orig. by jeremy uejio) to load bug
   reports in a buffer:

   rick


   (defun bugtraq-clear-buffer(name)
     "Visits and clears the buffer named NAME"
     (interactive "sBuffer name: ")
     (switch-to-buffer name)
     (end-of-buffer)
     (delete-region 1 (point)))

   (defun print-bug(id)
     "Prints bug ID in *id* buffer name"
     (interactive "sBug id: ")
     (bugtraq-clear-buffer (concat "*" id "*"))
     (message "printing bug %s" id)
       (call-process "/usr/dist/exe/bugprint"
		   nil 
		   (concat "*" id "*")
		   t 
		   id)
     (beginning-of-buffer)
     (message "done."))

But you first need to *visit* a bug.  I presume you must do something
like C-xC-f /net/elmer/....

Also, why would you ever want to switch to this buffer and delete its
entire contents?

   But you first need to *visit* a bug.  I presume you must do something
   like C-xC-f /net/elmer/....

you're not following, it does a call-process on the 
/usr/dist/exe/bugprint utility.


   Also, why would you ever want to switch to this buffer and delete its
   entire contents?

the buffer name is the bug id, not anything you'd be
using for a real buffer name.  if you've already loaded
it and want to see an update, you don't need the old junk.
it's a matter of preference I suppose.

	Correct.  You can forget about this one.

>  idea what this does.

	This is a compiler front end option.  It causes 'while' and
	'for' loops to be compiled with a test at the loop top, and
	an unconditional backward branch at the end of the loop.  This
	contrasts with the usual translation, which duplicates the loop
	test at both bottom and top.   The duplicate test is better for
	optimizing "most" loops, since it provides a good target for loop
	invariant code motion:

		if (<loop test>) {
		    <invariants go here>
		    do {
			<loop body>
		    } while (<loop test>);
		}

	The drawback is a slight code space penalty, due to the loop test
	duplication.  For loops that are all test and no body (e.g., in
	the C library string routines), the test-at-top translation may
	be slightly preferable.   In future versions of the compiler,
	it might be enabled automatically by the -xspace option.

>  How does one find out the available options to
>  each of the compilation modules?

	The component-specific options passed via the
	"-W<component>,<option>" mechanism are intentionally
	undocumented/unsupported, usually for a good reason.  :)

>  -Xt is just ANSI "transition" mode ; I wouldn't think it has any direct
>  bearing on performance.  In fact, we should probably compile -Xc (full
>  ANSI conformance) wherever possible.

	Yes.   Actually, -Xt can degrade performance of single precision
	floating point arithmetic, by causing all floats to be implicitly
	promoted to double in expressions (matching the old K&R rules).

	This question should be directed at a kernel person.  Try
	Kevin Clarke (kjc@get1).   I think the kernel can use %g2-%g4
	as general purpose, caller-saved registers; of course, %g2-%g2
	have to be restored to their original values before returning
	to user mode.

	Whether or not the kernel uses %g2-%g4, a user-mode library
	should not use them.

	-xO3 also permits the compiler to optimize redundant loads
	and stores to/from nonlocal storage (global variables or heap
	allocated storage).   -O should arguably be defined as -xO3
	rather than -xO2, and probably will be in a future version
	of the compiler.

	Combining -xO3 and -xspace permits the compiler to optimize
	nonlocal loads and stores, but suppresses loop unrolling.

Good status report John - very informative.

I want to remind you that I read every report you post, but
will not save them. Be sure you do this for future reviews.

Thx.

Goals for this week were:

	I would be happy if I can solve both the stereo problem
	and the uncorrolated overlay SOV problem this week.

Results:

	Firgured out the stereo problem.  Fixing it
	was too risky for smcc's FCS Tuesday, as
	the "fix" (implementation) would affect many
	common mpg regions and masks, and perhaps
	performance.  Explaination of this problem
	is in ~revelt/doc/stereo.txt, if anyone is
	interested.

	Had to look up and understand what happens
	if two visible/drawable plane groups
	are associated with one mpgInfo structure,
	by SMCC's request.  This was confusing
	because there were provisions in the code for
	more than one, but finally there was code
	specifically written to support only one.

	Worked on SOV again.  Got more operations
	working.  Added to test program to test
	text, found new bug to figure out.

Next Week:

	Try to get as much done with this SOV implementation
	as possible.

Thanks to Chris and Peter for the detailed and informative response to
my earlier questions.  Just one thing that's not quite clear:

Chris Aoki writes:

 > Whether or not the kernel uses %g2-%g4, a user-mode library should
 > not use them.

I'm not familiar with what the ABI says about %g2-%g4, and nobody in
this building seems to have a copy of the ABI book!  Can you elaborate?

Are you saying that all libraries _must_ be built with -xregs=no%appl ?

I've built the CDE libs without specifying this option (the default is
to use the appl registers), and they seems to work OK.  What are the
consequences of building a library without using -xregs=no%appl ?

Thanks,

    --- John.

If you used a compiler earlier than SC4.0,
then you did not need the flag "-xregs=no%appl".
It is only with SC4.0 and beyond that this flag is necessary.

The ABI reserves registers %g2-%g4 for the "application environment"
or some similar ambiguous phrase.
We interpret this to mean that an application
may choose to keep those registers live across a library/kernel call.
Callee saves code would be fine for a library (or the kernel),
but there is no way to tell SC4.0 to generate that type of code
(SC4.0 generates caller save code for %g2-%g4).

The consequence of not using "-xregs=no%appl" in a library
is that some applications may get broken by that library.

It is not necessarily the case that
all the code in an application comes from
the SC4.0 compiler, e.g. another compiler or assembly language.

The option was `-xcg89' rather than just `-cg89' .  From the man-page:

     -xcg89
          (SPARC) This option is a macro for:
          =xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1.

     -xcg92
          (SPARC) This option is a macro for:
          =xarch=v8 -xchip=super -xcache=16/64/4:1024/64/1.

Did you mean that -xcg89 (=xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1) is
equivalent to specifying the generic options?

Does this mean that the default is to not exploit any SPARC V8 features
and always generate v7 compliant code?

Yes, I meant "-xcg89" (other compilers spell it "-cg89").

And yes, the generic options generate V7 code,
because it hurts much more to run V8 code on V7 machines
than it helps V8 machines to run V8 instead of V7 code.
And there are lots of V7 machines...

There is a trade-off between having the best code
for some specific system and having code that will
run well on any SPARC system.
We've tried to make the right choices.

Peter.

Dear SunWorld Online Reader:
 
This is your SunWorld Online e-mail alert for December 1995. The
editors invite you to return to http://www.sun.com/sunworldonline to
read our December issue!

Webmasters and the managers who hire them must read our top story this
month, "They call me WEBMASTER." This feature kicks off our new
webmaster column by outlining the skills required to be an effective
webmaster, and offers essential links for folks responsible for Web
sites. Note this feature is not another tutorial on how to author home
pages, but offers hands-on technical help to people who know their way
around CGI scripts.

In our news department, we catch up on the latest Java announcements
(and what they mean), find what's hot and not in Unix employment, and
learn about the upcoming "three waves of Internet use."

In columns, our Java Developer columnist interviewed Arthur van Hoff
and Kim Polese, two members of the Java team who explain why Sun will 
implement a Java conformance test. In other columns this month, we cover:

	* Guarding the front door can leave the back door wide open. 
	  (Security)

	* Bending Windows 95 networking to your will part 2.
	  (Connectivity)

	* Our first performance Q&A FAQ. (Performance Q&A)

	* How to harden a Unix computer for Internet duty. (SysAdmin)

	* Tips for changing computer specialties in mid-stream. 
	  (Career Advisor)

	* Documents and client/server programs come together on the Web.
	  (Client/Server)

	* A six-step program to network computing success.
	  (Unix Enterprise) 

We update our new products section each week, and if you're looking for
SPARC- or Solaris-related URLs, sunWHERE contains more than 370
relevant links for you.

	This is a compiler front end option.  It causes 'while' and
	'for' loops to be compiled with a test at the loop top, and
	an unconditional backward branch at the end of the loop.  This
	contrasts with the usual translation, which duplicates the loop
	test at both bottom and top.   The duplicate test is better for
	optimizing "most" loops, since it provides a good target for loop
	invariant code motion:

		if (<loop test>) {
		    <invariants go here>
		    do {
			<loop body>
		    } while (<loop test>);
		}

	The drawback is a slight code space penalty, due to the loop test
	duplication.  For loops that are all test and no body (e.g., in
	the C library string routines), the test-at-top translation may
	be slightly preferable.   In future versions of the compiler,
	it might be enabled automatically by the -xspace option.

>  How does one find out the available options to

	The component-specific options passed via the
	"-W<component>,<option>" mechanism are intentionally
	undocumented/unsupported, usually for a good reason.  :)

	Yes.   Actually, -Xt can degrade performance of single precision
	floating point arithmetic, by causing all floats to be implicitly
	promoted to double in expressions (matching the old K&R rules).

	This question should be directed at a kernel person.  Try
	Kevin Clarke (kjc@get1).   I think the kernel can use %g2-%g4
	as general purpose, caller-saved registers; of course, %g2-%g2
	have to be restored to their original values before returning
	to user mode.

	Whether or not the kernel uses %g2-%g4, a user-mode library
	should not use them.

	-xO3 also permits the compiler to optimize redundant loads
	and stores to/from nonlocal storage (global variables or heap
	allocated storage).   -O should arguably be defined as -xO3
	rather than -xO2, and probably will be in a future version

Does dtmail have any support for creating and bursting digests?
VM appears to supports 2 formats, RFC1153 and RFC934.

With the advent of MIME, are digests no longer considered "in vogue"?

Will dtmail support them in the future?

Thanks,

    --- John.

The optimization performed at each level seems to differ for the various
supported platforms.  Unfortunately, I don't understand what many of
these actually do, eg. spill analysis, high & low level instruction
scheduling, loop strength reduction, etc.

Is -xO3 on SPARC "roughly equivalent" to -xO3 on x86/PowerPC?  Would you
recommend we also use -xO3 to build CDE for x86/PowerPC?

There seems to be no equivalent to "-xspace" on x86 and PowerPC.  Is it
simply not needed/inappropriate for these platforms?

Since "-xregs=no%appl" is only available on SPARC, is it also simply not
applicable on the other architectures?

MTV21 Occupants,

	In order to reorganize our server room, and enable ufs logging
on basilisk, (very fast reboots, and disaster recovery), basilisk, usr/dist,
and the install server will be in and out of service this saturday morning.

	We plan to start around 8:00am, and finish by noon.

	Let me know if this is not a good time for you to be without
these services.

There is no man page as far as I know, but the blue is idle, red is system time,
yellow is wait time, green is user time.

I never even got the source code for this tool.  If you want it you might ask
Bart who wrote the tool.  I don't think it was Bart but I think he knows
who did.

Dtmail source changes:

 Needed to fix some compilation errors (anachronisms) in libDtMail/Session.C

 Needed to move the `struct MessageCache' member of class RFCMailBox into
 the public part of the class definition to avoid another anachronism error.

 Replaced #ifdef 0 with #if 0

 Removed mapfile usage - the old maps are invalid due to the different
 mangling scheme used in the Cafe compiler.

I've been looking into whether CDE should use any of the SC4.0 compiler
options that are used in the kernel builds.  Here's what I found:


These are the SC4.0 compiler options used to build the kernel :

   -xO3 -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 -xregs=no%appl -xspace -W0,-Lt -Xt


 "-Wa,-cg92" is obsolete, and is just a nop.
 
 "-xcg89" is equivalent to the default, and thus doesn't really buy us
 anything.
 
 "-xregs=no%appl" should always be used in any public _libraries_ ;
 otherwise these libraries will not be fully ABI conformant.  This is
 important.  The option could actually have a slight performance penalty,
 but my initial observations indicate that (at least in some cases)
 available "out" registers are used instead of the globals with no
 performance penalty.  This option should not be used by applications.
 
 "-W0,-Lt" prevents loop test duplication.  However, duplicate loop tests
 are better in "most" cases, since they allow for loop invariant code
 motion, so in general, we should not use this.
 
 "-Xt" specifies ANSI transition mode.  This can actually degrade
 performance, since it causes all floats to be implicitly promoted to
 doubles in expressions.  Wherever possible, we should probably use -Xc
 for full ANSI conformance.
 
 "-xO3" specifies more optimization than the default -O or -xO2.  A
 notable difference is that globals are not assumed to be volatile, and
 redundant loads and stores are optimized away.
 
 "-xspace" disables optimizations that increase code size.  This prevents
 loop unrolling, which would have been done under -xO3.


If anyone would like further in-depth details on the above, drop me an
email and I'll forward a copy of my email discussions with some of the
compiler back end folks.


I first built libXm, libcsa and dtcm with the latest 4.0 compilers (18
October FCS build) using the default CDE build environment.

I then rebuilt each of the above with "-xO3 -xspace" and additionally
specified "-xregs=no%appl" for the Motif build.

Here are the various numbers:

================================= size =================================
DEFAULT:
 306 kontiki%> size dtcm
 435261 + 14532 + 24504 = 474297

NEW:
 298 kontiki%> size dtcm
 426961 + 14532 + 24500 = 465993


DEFAULT:
218 kontiki%> size libXm.so.3
1460194 + 124424 + 6472 = 1591090

NEW:
219 kontiki%> size libXm.so.3
1365082 + 124452 + 6468 = 1496002


The text segment for dtcm has shrunk by approx 10K.  As one would
expect, the size of the data and bss remain almost identical.  The text
segment for libXm has shrunk by almost 100K !

============================ detailed size =============================
DEFAULT:
307 kontiki%> size -f dtcm                                            ~/default
17(.interp) + 8008(.hash) + 15856(.dynsym) + 14267(.dynstr) + 32(.SUNW_version) + 24(.rela.ex_shared) + 36(.rela.data) + 348(.rela.bss) + 3612(.rela.plt) + 340564(.text) + 56(.init) + 56(.fini) + 4(.exception_ranges) + 264(.rodata) + 51901(.rodata1) + 4(.got) + 216(.dynamic) + 3664(.plt) + 32(.ex_shared) + 10616(.data) + 24500(.bss) = 474077

NEW:
299 kontiki%> size -f dtcm
17(.interp) + 8008(.hash) + 15856(.dynsym) + 14267(.dynstr) + 32(.SUNW_version) + 24(.rela.ex_shared) + 36(.rela.data) + 348(.rela.bss) + 3612(.rela.plt) + 332264(.text) + 56(.init) + 56(.fini) + 4(.exception_ranges) + 264(.rodata) + 51901(.rodata1) + 4(.got) + 216(.dynamic) + 3664(.plt) + 32(.ex_shared) + 10616(.data) + 24500(.bss) = 465777

This really just elaborates on the findings above.

==================== user and system time (startup) ====================
DEFAULT:

1.08s(u) 0.56s(s)
1.09s(u) 0.57s(s)
1.13s(u) 0.52s(s)
1.15s(u) 0.56s(s)
1.10s(u) 0.53s(s)
1.10s(u) 0.54s(s)

Mean: 1.11(u) 0.55(s)

NEW:

1.09s(u) 0.56s(s)
1.10s(u) 0.55s(s)
1.18s(u) 0.48s(s)
1.09s(u) 0.47s(s)

Mean: 1.13(u) 0.51(s)


The results are fairly inconclusive.  The new version seemed to spend a
little longer in user land, but a little less time in the system.  I
can't explain this.

===================== working set usage (startup) ======================

I've removed the information for the segments with sizes that didn't
change between the 2 different versions, otherwise this is `wsm' output,

DEFAULT:

 Read   Write   Mapped  PROT  Segment
   44       0     107   (R-X) dtcm
  196       0     357   (R-X) ./libXm.so.3
   25       0      38   (R-X) ./libcsa.so.0
    0       2       2   (RWX) ./libcsa.so.0
  700     275    1594         Totals

NEW:

 Read   Write   Mapped  PROT  Segment
   43       0     105   (R-X) dtcm
  191       0     334   (R-X) ./libXm.so.3
   22       0      36   (R-X) ./libcsa.so.0
    0       3       3   (RWX) ./libcsa.so.0

  691     275    1568         Totals

Just by compiling dtcm, libcsa and libXm with the new options resulted
in 9 fewer text pages being read and a reduction in the total mapping
size of 26 pages.

========================== `ps' size (in Kb) ===========================

DEFAULT:
    USER  RSS SIZE COMMAND
     jsc 4488 6280 ./dtcm
	 
NEW:	 
     jsc 4524 6376 ./dtcm

As noted above, the newer version is 26 pages (approx 100K) smaller.

========================================================================


Conclusions:

Despite a slight worsening in user time, the overall reduction in
working set seems to indicate a clear win for using the options "-xO3
-xspace".  Furthermore, all CDE libraries that are built with SC4.0 must
be built with -xregs=no%appl to maintain SPARC ABI conformance.


Other Issues:

The compiler options I used above are all supported by both the C and
C++ compilers.  However, neither -xspace nor -xregs=no%appl is available
under x86 or PowerPC.  Moreover, -xO3 has different semantics.  I'm
still trying to ascertain the impact of this.

I've been looking into whether CDE should use any of the SC4.0 compiler
options that are used in the kernel builds.  Here's what I found:


These are the SC4.0 compiler options used to build the kernel :

   -xO3 -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 -xregs=no%appl -xspace -W0,-Lt -Xt


 "-Wa,-cg92" is obsolete, and is just a nop.
 
 "-xcg89" is equivalent to the default, and thus doesn't really buy us
 anything.
 
 "-xregs=no%appl" should always be used in any public _libraries_ ;
 otherwise these libraries will not be fully ABI conformant.  This is
 important.  The option could actually have a slight performance penalty,
 but my initial observations indicate that (at least in some cases)

 "-W0,-Lt" prevents loop test duplication.  However, duplicate loop tests
 are better in "most" cases, since they allow for loop invariant code

 "-Xt" specifies ANSI transition mode.  This can actually degrade

Let me know if you want me to also roll the numbers for dtmail, as in my
previous message for dtcm.

You can find the dtcm experiment in:

 /net/kontiki/space/jsc/xO3/
 /net/kontiki/space/jsc/default/

Just set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the above and run the binary there.

I have a couple of questions about the 4.0 compiler switches - Lee
Bieber mentioned I should direct them to this alias.

 
 Dave asked me to investigate the 4.0 C compiler switches you mentioned
 are used in the kernel to see if we might employ them to improve
 performance in CDE apps:
 
 > -xO3 -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 -xregs=no%appl -xspace -W0,-Lt -Xt
 
 -Wa,-cg92 just passes '-cg92' to the assembler.  This option doesn't
 appear to be supported by the assembler (fbe) and seems to be a noop.
 
 -W0,-Lt passes the -Lt option to the compiler (acomp and ssbd).  I've no
 idea what this does.  How does one find out the available options to
 each of the compilation modules?
 
 -Xt is just ANSI "transition" mode ; I wouldn't think it has any direct
 bearing on performance.  In fact, we should probably compile -Xc (full
 ANSI conformance) wherever possible.
 
 Why is the kernel using -xregs=no%appl - the man-page states that it
 disallows using the registers g2, g3 and g4.  I would have thought that
 juggling data between fewer registers would hinder performance.
 
 
 -xspace and -xO3 appear to somewhat contradict each other :
 
 -xO3 does loop unrolling and pipelining, resulting in larger code.
 -xspace prevents size increases and avoids loop unrolling.
 
 Is the combination of these options a no-op, or is there some other
 benefit from using these options together?  What is "pipelining"?  Is
 the net effect to suppress loop unrolling but enable pipelining?
 
 
 -xcg89 seems to optimize for the lowest common denominator; it's
 equivalent to:
 
           =xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1.
 
 Surely, each kernel is built for a _specific_ architecture; why is this
 done?
 
 Wouldn't the default -xchip=generic (Use timing properties for good
 performance on most SPARCs.) be a good choice, or does this fail to
 produce working code on older architectures?
 
 Same question for -xarch=generic and -xcache=generic .
 
 Thanks for any information,
 
     --- John.

I'd say that sc-hotline@devpro.eng is a good place to send these questions.
I'll try to answer these.

That was a hack for the SC2.0.1 compilers.
It is a nop for SC3.0 and beyond.

I have no idea on this one.

It may be that there is still quite a bit of pre-ANSI C code in the kernel.
Certainly "-Xc" ensures more portability, but it depends on your code
whether it generates correct code (or even compiles).

This is a SPARC ABI issue.  Neither the kernel nor any libraries
that might be linked into an application may use registers %g2-%g4.

The "-xO3" level of optimization does more analysis and more optimization.
The "-xspace" does turn off or limit some of the optimizations
at "-xO3", but you should still get better code with "-xO3 -xspace"
than with "-xO2" or "-O" (at some cost in compile time).
One important difference is the assumption at "-xO2" that
all globals are volatile, thus prohibiting many optimizations.

As far as I know, there is only one version of the kernel for Solaris 2.0-2.4.
However, in Solaris 2.5 and beyond, this may be less true.

Yes, it would probably be better to use the generic options
(note that they are the default).
The "-cg89" is another relic from older compilers (i.e. SC2.0.1).
However, I don't think there is currently much, if any, difference
between "-cg89" and the generic options currently.

	Correct.  You can forget about this one.

>  idea what this does.

	This is a compiler front end option.  It causes 'while' and
	'for' loops to be compiled with a test at the loop top, and
	an unconditional backward branch at the end of the loop.  This
	contrasts with the usual translation, which duplicates the loop
	test at both bottom and top.   The duplicate test is better for
	optimizing "most" loops, since it provides a good target for loop
	invariant code motion:

		if (<loop test>) {
		    <invariants go here>
		    do {
			<loop body>
		    } while (<loop test>);
		}

	The drawback is a slight code space penalty, due to the loop test
	duplication.  For loops that are all test and no body (e.g., in
	the C library string routines), the test-at-top translation may
	be slightly preferable.   In future versions of the compiler,
	it might be enabled automatically by the -xspace option.

>  How does one find out the available options to
>  each of the compilation modules?

	The component-specific options passed via the
	"-W<component>,<option>" mechanism are intentionally
	undocumented/unsupported, usually for a good reason.  :)

>  -Xt is just ANSI "transition" mode ; I wouldn't think it has any direct
>  bearing on performance.  In fact, we should probably compile -Xc (full
>  ANSI conformance) wherever possible.

	Yes.   Actually, -Xt can degrade performance of single precision
	floating point arithmetic, by causing all floats to be implicitly
	promoted to double in expressions (matching the old K&R rules).

	This question should be directed at a kernel person.  Try
	Kevin Clarke (kjc@get1).   I think the kernel can use %g2-%g4
	as general purpose, caller-saved registers; of course, %g2-%g2
	have to be restored to their original values before returning
	to user mode.

	Whether or not the kernel uses %g2-%g4, a user-mode library
	should not use them.

	-xO3 also permits the compiler to optimize redundant loads
	and stores to/from nonlocal storage (global variables or heap
	allocated storage).   -O should arguably be defined as -xO3
	rather than -xO2, and probably will be in a future version
	of the compiler.

	Combining -xO3 and -xspace permits the compiler to optimize
	nonlocal loads and stores, but suppresses loop unrolling.

I'm not familiar with what the ABI says about %g2-%g4, and nobody in
this building seems to have a copy of the ABI book!  Can you elaborate?

Are you saying that all libraries _must_ be built with -xregs=no%appl ?

I've built the CDE libs without specifying this option (the default is
to use the appl registers), and they seems to work OK.  What are the
consequences of building a library without using -xregs=no%appl ?

Thanks,

If you used a compiler earlier than SC4.0,
then you did not need the flag "-xregs=no%appl".
It is only with SC4.0 and beyond that this flag is necessary.

The ABI reserves registers %g2-%g4 for the "application environment"
or some similar ambiguous phrase.
We interpret this to mean that an application
may choose to keep those registers live across a library/kernel call.
Callee saves code would be fine for a library (or the kernel),
but there is no way to tell SC4.0 to generate that type of code
(SC4.0 generates caller save code for %g2-%g4).

The consequence of not using "-xregs=no%appl" in a library
is that some applications may get broken by that library.

Peter.

Sounds good, except your final comment baffles me.  If SC4.0 generates
caller save code for %g2-%g4, then why does it matter if the callee
(library function) stomps on those registers?  (since presumably the
caller will also restore the saved regs after the callee returns)

It is not necessarily the case that
all the code in an application comes from
the SC4.0 compiler, e.g. another compiler or assembly language.

The option was `-xcg89' rather than just `-cg89' .  From the man-page:

     -xcg89
          (SPARC) This option is a macro for:
          =xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1.

     -xcg92
          (SPARC) This option is a macro for:
          =xarch=v8 -xchip=super -xcache=16/64/4:1024/64/1.

Did you mean that -xcg89 (=xarch=v7 -xchip=old -xcache=64/32/1) is
equivalent to specifying the generic options?

Does this mean that the default is to not exploit any SPARC V8 features
and always generate v7 compliant code?

Yes, I meant "-xcg89" (other compilers spell it "-cg89").

And yes, the generic options generate V7 code,
because it hurts much more to run V8 code on V7 machines
than it helps V8 machines to run V8 instead of V7 code.
And there are lots of V7 machines...

There is a trade-off between having the best code
for some specific system and having code that will
run well on any SPARC system.
We've tried to make the right choices.

Peter.

These options are used to build the libraries. The kernel options are
slightly different.

Interesting, I did not know that. I wonder if I should change things to
say -xarch=v8 -xchip=generic for the generic code. That should be
the equivalent statement to what -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 used to be.

Correct. Only Solaris libraries and the dynamic linker use this
option.

Apps and the kernel are free to use all the registers that the ABI
states they can.

this is important for the kernel. This option was specifically arrived
at because the bootblks weren't fitting in their alloted 15*512b size
allocation. This may not be a good option for you guys because of the
reason John outlined.

These options are used to build the libraries. The kernel options are
slightly different.

Interesting, I did not know that. I wonder if I should change things to
say -xarch=v8 -xchip=generic for the generic code. That should be
the equivalent statement to what -xcg89 -Wa,-cg92 used to be.

Correct. Only Solaris libraries and the dynamic linker use this
option.

Apps and the kernel are free to use all the registers that the ABI
states they can.

this is important for the kernel. This option was specifically arrived
at because the bootblks weren't fitting in their alloted 15*512b size
allocation. This may not be a good option for you guys because of the
reason John outlined.

Sorry for the confusion on your questions. Let me try to answer them.
If you need more info, let me know.

  --> 
  --> The optimization performed at each level seems to differ for the various
  --> supported platforms.  Unfortunately, I don't understand what many of
  --> these actually do, eg. spill analysis, high & low level instruction
  --> scheduling, loop strength reduction, etc.
  --> 
  --> Is -xO3 on SPARC "roughly equivalent" to -xO3 on x86/PowerPC?  Would you
  --> recommend we also use -xO3 to build CDE for x86/PowerPC?
yes, "roughly equivalent" is a good term, we try as much as possible with
the Metaware backend to match intel and ppc on sparc.
Please try -xO3 and let us know of any problems
  --> 
  --> There seems to be no equivalent to "-xspace" on x86 and PowerPC.  Is it
  --> simply not needed/inappropriate for these platforms?
  --> 
We will be syncing the flags for the 4.2 release so you will see -xspace
on the platforms. Currently there is no equivalent.

  --> Since "-xregs=no%appl" is only available on SPARC, is it also simply not
  --> applicable on the other architectures?
  --> 
Correct, not applicable. However will be recognized in 4.2 but no action will
be taken on intel and ppc.

-John,

The two RFCs you refer to are not standards - RFC1153 is an elective
experimental protocol dated April 1990, and RFC934 is a proposed protocol
dated January 1985. Both have been superceeded by the MIME standard
RFC1521, which does include a "digest" and other types of multipart
messages. 

There is no plan for dtmail to support the two RFCs you refer to.

	The (undocumented) component-specific option "-Wa,-cg92" is
	an artifact of the 2.0.1 compilation system.   In SC2.0.1,
	instruction scheduling was done by the assembler.  The
	meaning of the option was: "tell the assembler to schedule
	the instructions using a SuperSparc machine model".

	In SC3.0 and subsequent compiler versions, assembly and instruction
	scheduling are integrated with the optimizing code generator,
	and the assembler is not used at all, unless the input to the
	compiler is a .s file.  In this case, instructions are not
	rescheduled, and no other optimizations are done.  Thus, the
	option string "-Wa,-cg92" has no effect under the current
	version of the compiler.

	The (documented) option -xarch=v8 governs instruction selection,
	not instruction scheduling.  Using this option to compile "generic"
	code for old Sparcs (including SS-2's) would be a bad idea, as it
	would cause the compiler to generate V8 integer multiply/divide
	instructions.

	The default setting ("-xarch=generic -xchip=generic", or "")
	will generate code that runs on any Sparc machine newer than
	the original Sun4, and will schedule instructions using a

	The (undocumented) component-specific option "-Wa,-cg92" is
	an artifact of the 2.0.1 compilation system.   In SC2.0.1,
	instruction scheduling was done by the assembler.  The
	meaning of the option was: "tell the assembler to schedule
	the instructions using a SuperSparc machine model".

	In SC3.0 and subsequent compiler versions, assembly and instruction
	scheduling are integrated with the optimizing code generator,
	and the assembler is not used at all, unless the input to the
	compiler is a .s file.  In this case, instructions are not
	rescheduled, and no other optimizations are done.  Thus, the
	option string "-Wa,-cg92" has no effect under the current
	version of the compiler.

	The (documented) option -xarch=v8 governs instruction selection,
	not instruction scheduling.  Using this option to compile "generic"
	code for old Sparcs (including SS-2's) would be a bad idea, as it
	would cause the compiler to generate V8 integer multiply/divide
	instructions.

	The default setting ("-xarch=generic -xchip=generic", or "")
	will generate code that runs on any Sparc machine newer than
	the original Sun4, and will schedule instructions using a
	SuperSparc machine model.  I believe this is equivalent to
	the SC2.0.1 option string "-xcg89 -Wa,-cg92".

Currently, with SC4.0, we should just use "-xO3" on x86 and PowerPC.

When SC4.2 arrives, we should be able to consistently use the same
options across the various platforms.

Sorry for the confusion on your questions. Let me try to answer them.
If you need more info, let me know.

  --> recommend we also use -xO3 to build CDE for x86/PowerPC?
yes, "roughly equivalent" is a good term, we try as much as possible with
the Metaware backend to match intel and ppc on sparc.
Please try -xO3 and let us know of any problems
  --> 
  --> There seems to be no equivalent to "-xspace" on x86 and PowerPC.  Is it
  --> simply not needed/inappropriate for these platforms?
  --> 
We will be syncing the flags for the 4.2 release so you will see -xspace
on the platforms. Currently there is no equivalent.

  --> Since "-xregs=no%appl" is only available on SPARC, is it also simply not
  --> applicable on the other architectures?
  --> 
Correct, not applicable. However will be recognized in 4.2 but no action will
be taken on intel and ppc.

We could do this.  If you build me two libtt versions, one with the
defaults, and one with "-xO3 -xspace -xregs=no%appl", we can dynamically
link it with dtcm and roll the numbers.  Be careful to not specify -O as
well as -xO3, since some Makefiles specify -O twice and I'm not sure if
there are any precedence rules.

To get the latest compilers, put /net/on297/opt/SUNWspro/bin at the head
of your PATH and check that cc -V indicates it's the 18 October build.

Yes, well spotted; I had mistakenly transposed them.  I just rechecked,
and the new -xO3 version is the smaller one.

 > What difference does using this make in the performance benchmark?

Don't know yet, but since the new flags reduce working set, and CDE is
highly memory-bound, we're optimistic they'll speed up the benchmark.

I've just rebuilt dtcm, libcsa and libXm with the default SC2.0.1
compilers with the default -O optimization to make a direct comparison
with the SC4.0 compilers.

Here are the basic numbers (comparing just -O in both cases):

================================= size =================================
SC2.0.1
436233 + 14468 + 24500 = 475201

SC4.0
435261 + 14532 + 24504 = 474297
============================= working set ==============================
SC2.0.1
  700     274    1584         Totals

SC4.0
  700     275    1594         Totals
===================================  ===================================

It seems that -O produces similar sized code under SC2.0.1 and SC4.0.
However, the win with moving to SC4.0 is that we can use "-xO3 -xspace"
to gain the benefits I listed in my previous mail.  "-xspace" isn't
available under SC2.0.1, so the extra optimization would bloat the
binaries in this environment.

Who's in charge of builds?  We'd like to get hold of a full new build
that uses the SC4.0 compilers and incorporates the optimization
switches, so we can see how the benchmark fares overall.

Note: The 4.0 C++ compiler (Cafe) is quite different to the 2.0.1 C++
(cfront translator), and I found that various source changes were
necessary to build dtmail.  However, we need to take this (minor) plunge
some time, and the source changes should be pretty straightforward.  As
far as I know, there shouldn't be any need to modify the C components.

Just a reminder...

Thursday, December 7, SPG employees will be going to see Toy Story.

I've had a lot of questions regarding the movie.


1) TICKETS - the "SPG EMPLOYEE TOY STORY Movie Pass" is required to 
   get into the movie, we can not give you another one at the door.
   The theatre uses these to bill Sun.

2) WHO - this showing is for employees only, no contractors, no temps,
   etc.  Due to our limited space, we can not have contractors attend. 

3) FAMILY MEMBERS - no, again because of limited space. Even if you 
   were to offer to pay for others and just have them sit with you, 
   we can't, there is just enough space for SPG employees only. 

4) REFRESHMENTS - you will be getting a voucher for refreshments
   at the snack bar, (ie. soda, popcorn, hotdog) when you arrive. 
   The vouchers will be passes out as you enter the theatre.  

5) LIMO SERVICE - There is none. No bus service either. You will
   need to drive yourself (and others if you care to carpool).

6) REMOTE SITES - This showing is for Mountain View employees.
   I am working with the other sites to schedule showings for
   sites with larger groups of employees.


Thanks,
Vici

There will be a special showing of "Toy Story" for all
SPG employees on Thursday, December 7.

The movie begins at 12:00noon. You will need a special 
pass to get into the theatre, which will be passed out 
next week.  Refreshments will also be served.

Due to limited space, this showing is only for SunSoft
SPG employees, no temps or contractors.

FYI, this theater is an easy 25-minute walk from MTV21, so you can burn off
those popcorn calories if the weather cooperates.

The pre FCS 4.0 compilers in xsun3:/opt/SUNWspro will be unavailable
for ~1 hour while I install the FCS verions.  Kevin needs them to do
builds with.   /export/space8/SC4.0, their real location, will still
work during this time.

At least one person has a Calistoga bugfix and has asked about the CRT
process, so I thought I'd send this out a bit early.  Due to the
Thanksgiving holiday and a couple of people being out sick (including me),
we're a few days behind but expect to be up and running in a couple of
days.  The process will be just like the previous one (bugids, advisors,
etc.), so if you have a bugfix already just make sure the bug report
is complete and watch this space for the formal CRT process announcement.

Again, remember to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to these directories to also pick

Hello Movie Fans:

If you were in when I went by today, I handed you a Movie Pass for Toy Story.  
If you were not in, please see me at my cube #4205 in MTV21 to receive 
your pass, unless you do not plan to attend.  The passes are not transferable.
See some notes about the movie below. 

	The date is Thursday 12/7/95 12 - 2PM
	  Mountain View Century 16 


Thursday, December 7, SPG employees will be going to see Toy Story.

I've had a lot of questions regarding the movie.


1) TICKETS - the "SPG EMPLOYEE TOY STORY Movie Pass" is required to 
   get into the movie, we can not give you another one at the door.
   The theatre uses these to bill Sun.

2) WHO - this showing is for employees only, no contractors, no temps,
   etc.  Due to our limited space, we can not have contractors attend. 

3) FAMILY MEMBERS - no, again because of limited space. Even if you 
   were to offer to pay for others and just have them sit with you, 
   we can't, there is just enough space for SPG employees only. 

4) REFRESHMENTS - you will be getting a voucher for refreshments
   at the snack bar, (ie. soda, popcorn, hotdog) when you arrive. 
   The vouchers will be passes out as you enter the theatre.  

5) LIMO SERVICE - There is none. No bus service either. You will
   need to drive yourself (and others if you care to carpool).

6) REMOTE SITES - This showing is for Mountain View employees.
   I am working with the other sites to schedule showings for
   sites with larger groups of employees.

WHY -- AND HOW -- YOU'LL BANK ONLINE IN '96


What happens when Bill Gates gets together with 3,000 bankers? They decide your
financial future, of course. The Microsoft chief outlined his vision for
electronic banking Tuesday in Atlanta at a conference of the Bank Administration
Institute. He was joined by Scott Cook, who heads Intuit, manufacturer of the
popularQuicken  and Gates's fiercest rival in the field of personal finance
software. Between them, the chairmen described several changes coming to online
banking in the next year that will make managing your accounts on your PC hard
to resist.  

First, a little history. The potential for banking electronically has existed
for a decade, but as recently as six months ago, only a handful of banks offered
these digital dialup transactions. And the ones that did typically forced you to
use their own clunky connection software, and charged $8 to $20 per month for
the privilege.

That all changed this year when Microsoft, facing antitrust inquiries from the
U.S. Justice Department, dropped its springtime bid to acquire Intuit. Instead
of gobbling up his rival, Gates now had to compete with Cook. And within a few
months, electronic banking hit the mass market in a big way. 

In August, new versions of Intuit's Quicken  and Microsoft Money  appeared, each
with electronic banking capabilities, and both companies issued lists of about
20 banks that agreed to let customers use the new software to connect to their
accounts. Fees began to drop: most banks now charge about $3 a month for digital
access (which still turns a tidy profit, as electronic transactions are on
average 50% to 70% cheaper for banks to handle than human ones).

Next, Intuit moved online. In late October, it said customers would be able to
reach its partner banks through free software that can be downloaded from
America Online. And this week, Intuit announced plans to provide on-line banking
over the Internet: users will be able to obtain freeware from the Quicken
Financial Network  that will let them connect to cooperating banks. 

While Intuit hopes to cash in on fee revenues from electronic banking (expected
to grow from $1 billion today to $18 billion by 2000), Microsoft seems to be
retreating from the strategy of building its own banking network. Gates's speech
Tuesday, for example, focused on issues like "providing Internet tools to
establish virtual branches" and "securing rich e-mail for bank-customer
communications" -- services to banks, not consumers. Microsoft denies any change
in its basic orientation, but experts say Gates's e-mail and World Wide Web
programs are simply better than his personal finance products. That means
Microsoft is likely to focus more on developing Internet protocols and software
for large banks than competing head-to-head with Intuit's proprietary network.

All this leaves you with a ledger full of new banking opportunities. By this
time next year you'll be able to check balances, shift funds, and pay bills in
four digital ways:

Some banks, such as Chase, will continue to offer their own software for direct
access to your accounts.

 You can continue to use Quicken  or Microsoft Money  to connect to a
participating bank.

You'll be able to obtain software to connect to Intuit's partners from libraries
on America Online or the Quicken  Financial Network.

You'll start to see banks offering transactions directly on the Internet -- that
is, you'll be able to enter commands right at bank Web sites. (The first bank
Web site, is already up and running).

Electronic banking has always offered customers wider choice among banks and
greater control of their accounts. Now, with fees dropping and access software
easily available, it's due for a real explosion in popularity. Bottom line: the
population of PC users who bank electronically is expected to grow from about
100,000 today to more than 1 million in the next 12 months.

To:		SunSoft
From:		Janpieter Scheerder
Subject:	SunSoft Desktop Business

As part of my ongoing examination of the SunSoft mission, strategy,
deliverables and organization, I have decided that SunSoft needs to 
increase our focus and energy on Desktop opportunities.  For SunSoft
to be successful as a network information software company, it is
critical that we have strong products on both the desktop and the
server to allow customers to develop, deploy and manage their 
mission-critical information. 

Based on recommendations from my staff and others, I have decided to
form a single group to concentrate on defining and expanding SunSoft's 
desktop business.  This group will develop SunSoft's business and product
strategy for end user customers, including desktop applications, client
application environments and blah blah blah.

I have asked Paula Sager, VP Desktop Products, to lead this new group,
which will combine the Personal Computer and Desktop Integration (PCDI)
group in Chelmsford and the Solaris Desktop Technologies group in 
Mountain View.  Since SunSoft delivers our end user products as a bundled 
part of Solaris, this new desktop group will be a part of the Solaris 
Products Group (SPG).  Paula Sager will report to Steve MacKay, VP/GM of SPG.

SunSoft's goal in forming this new group is to expand and enhance our
desktop offerings  Thus, I want to assure everyone, especially those people
in PCDI, that this does not lessen the importance of the desktop work being 
done on the East Coast.  You need to continue with the development efforts 
that are underway, and there will be additional future desktop projects 
to be done in Chelmsford as well.

Please support Paula and her new group as they move forward to expand
SunSoft's desktop product line and improve our ability to make our
customers successful.

Subject: Identifying security related bugs in BugTraq
To:   All BugTraq Users

Because there has been a heightened interest and awareness in computer
security here at Sun, we need to be able to track security-related bugs
in the BugTraq database.

To aid the querying for security related bugs, we are establishing a
convention to mark them as such. The method is simple, when filing a
bug having to do with security, simply add the word 'security' to the
"Keywords:" field of the bug report.

If you are editing an older bug that is a security related bug, but
does not have 'security' in the "Keywords:" field, then please add it.

Thanks for your cooperation,
The BugTraq Group

Ignore step 1.

Also if you put the cache somewhere other than /cache you have to
change the vfstab line in two places.

 Bug Id: 1221794
 Category: cde
 Subcategory: motif
 Bug/Rfe: bug
 State: integrated
 Synopsis: _XmConst is never really "const" and other data section bloat
 Keywords: bloat, section, data, "const", _xmconst, per-client, memory, wasting, -xstrconst, libs, cde
 Severity: 4
 Priority: 4
 Responsible Manager: jenks
 Responsible Engineer: 
 Description: 

The .data section in libXm is full of string data and other junk like x bitmaps
which could be made read-only and thus be shared across the desktop.  Part
of this problem stems from the fact that the _XmConst macro is never really
defined as anything useful by the time it gets into the code, no matter which
compile mode (-X[c|a|s|t) is used and what the value of __STDC__ is.

To demonstrate this use the following example:

---------------------------------
#include <Xm/XmP.h>

/*
 * Save as "foo.c"
 *
 * Compile as follows and examine the resulting
 * definition for the variable "FOO".  Vary the
 * -X? option.
 *
 * $ cc -Xc -E -c foo.c -I/usr/dt/include -I/usr/openwin/include | grep FOO
 */

static _XmConst char* FOO = "bar";
---------------------------------


The rest of the problem is that the code is littered with bitmap data
declarations, strings initialized to character arrays rather than pointers,
and miscellaneous static initializers which are not marked as "const"
even by way of the _XmConst macro.

These are the results of a prototype library I put together that const'izes
what it can.  Note that .data itself is brought down by ~90%!  (picdata is
something the new linter adds in, dunno how to fit that into the numbers
verses the FCS library):

# FCS 1.01 version
size -F /usr/dt/lib/libXm.so.3.orig 
1434478(r-x) + 133484(rwx) = 1567962

size -f /usr/dt/lib/libXm.so.3.orig
15260(.hash) + 30592(.dynsym) + 37427(.dynstr) + 75252(.rela.data) + 28440(.rela.got) + 12900(.rela.plt) + 1198156(.text) + 12(.init) + 12(.fini) + 424(.rodata) + 35854(.rodata1) + 9484(.got) + 152(.dynamic) + 12952(.plt) + 104428(.data) + 6468(.bss) = 1567813

# My constized version
size -F libXm.so.3.rmg
1518050(r-x) + 73824(rwx) = 1591874

size -f libXm.so.3.rmg
15268(.hash) + 30624(.dynsym) + 37345(.dynstr) + 24(.rela.ex_shared) + 14040(.rela.data) + 61212(.rela.picdata) + 20832(.rela.got) + 12900(.rela.plt) + 1242844(.text) + 56(.init) + 56(.fini) + 4(.exception_ranges) + 57130(.rodata) + 25558(.rodata1) + 6948(.got) + 152(.dynamic) + 12952(.plt) + 32(.ex_shared) + 12472(.data) + 34796(.picdata) + 6468(.bss) = 1591713

 Suggested fix: 

In my proto library, I made the XtResource and XtActionsRec arrays const
in each of the widgets.  I believe that is a safe assumption.

Also, lookout for static tables, bitmaps and other stuff littered throughout
the code but declared somewhere in the middle of the file.

 Synopsis: drag & drop: if pointer is moved quickly then stopped, the icon doesn't catch up
 Keywords: doesn't, icon, stopped, quickly, pointer, drop, &, drag
 Severity: 3
 Priority: 3
 Responsible Manager: jenks
 Responsible Engineer: 
 Description: 
In Motif2.0 drag and drop if the pointer is moved quickly, then stopped, the icon will
not be drawn at the current pointer location.  If the pointer is then "jiggled", the icon
will catch up.  This is easy to reproduce on the first drag after an app is started.

The problem is in DragC.c:DragMotion().  DragMotion() is an action triggered by
Enter/Leave/Motion events.  UpdateMotionBuffer() called from DragMotion() gathers
all motion events in the X queue, and then compresses them and draws the icon at it's
new position in ProcessMotionBuffer().

When the pointer is moved quickly and then stopped, MotionNotify events aren't
generated, only EnterNotify and LeaveNotify.  UpdateMotionBuffer doesn't gather
Enter/Leave events so ProcessMotionBuffer doesn't draw anything.

A simple solution to this is to check to see if the motionBuffer is empty.  It really shouldn't
be since we know that DragMotion was called because of an Enter/Leave/Motion event.
If it is empty and the current event is an Enter/Leave, add the current event to the 
motionBuffer.

    if ((motionBuffer->count == 0) &&
        ((current.type == EnterNotify) || (current.type == LeaveNotify)) )
    {
        current.type = MotionNotify;
        UpdateMotionBuffer(dc, motionBuffer,current);
    }
 
    ProcessMotionBuffer(dc, motionBuffer);
    XFlush(XtDisplayOfObject((Widget) dc));

Another possible solution is to modify UpdateMotionBuffer to treat Enter/Leave events
the same as Motion events.  There might be problems if these are interspersed with
Motion events.

 Synopsis: drag & drop: the icon isn't always dropped where the button is released
 Keywords: released, button, dropped, isn't, icon, drop, &, drag
 Severity: 3
 Priority: 2
 Responsible Manager: jenks
 Responsible Engineer: 
 Description: 
In Motif2.0 drag and drop, the icon doesn't always drop where the button is released.
This is easy to reproduce on the first drag when a app is started.  Drag quickly and then
release over a valid drop site.  Many times the drag will fail anyway.

Btn2 release is processed by FinishAction().  The drop should occur at the coordinates
of the button release not at the last Motion event that was processed.  The solution
is to add code to FinishAction() to process the drop at the button release site.

static void
#ifdef _NO_PROTO
FinishAction( dc, ev )
        XmDragContext dc ;
        XEvent *ev ;
#else
FinishAction(
        XmDragContext dc,
        XEvent *ev )
#endif /* _NO_PROTO */
{
    unsigned int        state = 0;
    Arg                 args[5];
    Cardinal            i = 0;
    XmDisplay           dd = (XmDisplay) XmGetXmDisplay(XtDisplay(dc));
 
/* INSERT */

        int dummyx, dummyy;
        Window protoWindow;
 
        (void) XTranslateCoordinates(XtDisplay(dc), dc->drag.currWmRoot,
                                     dc->drag.currWmRoot,
                                     ev->xbutton.x_root, ev->xbutton.y_root,
                                     &dummyx, &dummyy,
                                     &protoWindow);
 
        DragMotionProto( dc, dc->drag.currWmRoot, protoWindow );
    }
/* INSERT */

...

       i = 0;
       XtSetArg(args[i], XmNhotX, dc->core.x); i++;
       XtSetArg(args[i], XmNhotY, dc->core.y); i++;
       if (currentActiveMode == XmCURSOR ||
           (currentMode != XmDRAG_WINDOW && currentMode != XmWINDOW) ) {
/* INSERT */
         /*
          * We must move the drag over shell to the location where
          * the mouse button was released.  Otherwise the drag icon
          * will popup at the last location the window was used and
          * then move to the current location.  This causes flashing
          */
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNx, ev->xbutton.x_root); i++;
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNy, ev->xbutton.y_root); i++;
/* INSERT */
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNdragOverMode, XmWINDOW); i++;
       }
       XtSetValues((Widget) dc->drag.curDragOver, args, i);

This last bit of code moves the dragover shell to the location of the button release.
It must be moved or else the dragover shell will be mapped into the old location and
the immediately moved to the new location.  This causes unnecessary flashing.
I've seen an X protocol error recently that is due to this code.  I'll look into it.  The
basic bug will be fixed without it but it would be nice to fix the flashing, too.

 Public Summary: 
In Motif2.0 drag and drop, the icon doesn't always drop where the button is released.
This is easy to reproduce on the first drag when a app is started.  Drag quickly and then
release over a valid drop site.  Many times the drag will fail anyway.

Btn2 release is processed by FinishAction().  The drop should occur at the coordinates
of the button release not at the last Motion event that was processed.  The solution
is to add code to FinishAction() to process the drop at the button release site.

static void
#ifdef _NO_PROTO
FinishAction( dc, ev )
        XmDragContext dc ;
        XEvent *ev ;
#else
FinishAction(
        XmDragContext dc,
        XEvent *ev )
#endif /* _NO_PROTO */
{
    unsigned int        state = 0;
    Arg                 args[5];
    Cardinal            i = 0;
    XmDisplay           dd = (XmDisplay) XmGetXmDisplay(XtDisplay(dc));
 
/* INSERT */

        int dummyx, dummyy;
        Window protoWindow;
 
        (void) XTranslateCoordinates(XtDisplay(dc), dc->drag.currWmRoot,
                                     dc->drag.currWmRoot,
                                     ev->xbutton.x_root, ev->xbutton.y_root,
                                     &dummyx, &dummyy,
                                     &protoWindow);
 
        DragMotionProto( dc, dc->drag.currWmRoot, protoWindow );
    }
/* INSERT */

...

       i = 0;
       XtSetArg(args[i], XmNhotX, dc->core.x); i++;
       XtSetArg(args[i], XmNhotY, dc->core.y); i++;
       if (currentActiveMode == XmCURSOR ||
           (currentMode != XmDRAG_WINDOW && currentMode != XmWINDOW) ) {
/* INSERT */
         /*
          * We must move the drag over shell to the location where
          * the mouse button was released.  Otherwise the drag icon
          * will popup at the last location the window was used and
          * then move to the current location.  This causes flashing
          */
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNx, ev->xbutton.x_root); i++;
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNy, ev->xbutton.y_root); i++;
/* INSERT */
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNdragOverMode, XmWINDOW); i++;
       }
       XtSetValues((Widget) dc->drag.curDragOver, args, i);

This last bit of code moves the dragover shell to the location of the button release.
It must be moved or else the dragover shell will be mapped into the old location and
the immediately moved to the new location.  This causes unnecessary flashing.

 Bug Id: 1222754

 Bug/Rfe: bug
 State: integrated
 Synopsis: drag & drop: if pointer is moved quickly then stopped, the icon doesn't catch up
 Keywords: doesn't, icon, stopped, quickly, pointer, drop, &, drag
 Severity: 3
 Priority: 3
 Responsible Manager: jenks
 Responsible Engineer: hinkmond
 Description: 
In Motif2.0 drag and drop if the pointer is moved quickly, then stopped, the icon will
not be drawn at the current pointer location.  If the pointer is then "jiggled", the icon
will catch up.  This is easy to reproduce on the first drag after an app is started.

The problem is in DragC.c:DragMotion().  DragMotion() is an action triggered by
Enter/Leave/Motion events.  UpdateMotionBuffer() called from DragMotion() gathers
all motion events in the X queue, and then compresses them and draws the icon at it's
new position in ProcessMotionBuffer().

When the pointer is moved quickly and then stopped, MotionNotify events aren't
generated, only EnterNotify and LeaveNotify.  UpdateMotionBuffer doesn't gather
Enter/Leave events so ProcessMotionBuffer doesn't draw anything.

A simple solution to this is to check to see if the motionBuffer is empty.  It really shouldn't
be since we know that DragMotion was called because of an Enter/Leave/Motion event.
If it is empty and the current event is an Enter/Leave, add the current event to the 
motionBuffer.

    if ((motionBuffer->count == 0) &&
        ((current.type == EnterNotify) || (current.type == LeaveNotify)) )
    {
        current.type = MotionNotify;
        UpdateMotionBuffer(dc, motionBuffer,current);
    }
 
    ProcessMotionBuffer(dc, motionBuffer);
    XFlush(XtDisplayOfObject((Widget) dc));

Another possible solution is to modify UpdateMotionBuffer to treat Enter/Leave events
the same as Motion events.  There might be problems if these are interspersed with
Motion events.

 Bug Id: 1222771
 Category: cde
 Subcategory: motif
 Bug/Rfe: bug
 State: integrated
 Synopsis: drag & drop: the icon isn't always dropped where the button is released
 Keywords: released, button, dropped, isn't, icon, drop, &, drag
 Severity: 3
 Priority: 2
 Responsible Manager: jenks
 Responsible Engineer: hinkmond
 Description: 
In Motif2.0 drag and drop, the icon doesn't always drop where the button is released.
This is easy to reproduce on the first drag when a app is started.  Drag quickly and then
release over a valid drop site.  Many times the drag will fail anyway.

Btn2 release is processed by FinishAction().  The drop should occur at the coordinates
of the button release not at the last Motion event that was processed.  The solution
is to add code to FinishAction() to process the drop at the button release site.

static void
#ifdef _NO_PROTO
FinishAction( dc, ev )
        XmDragContext dc ;
        XEvent *ev ;
#else
FinishAction(
        XmDragContext dc,
        XEvent *ev )
#endif /* _NO_PROTO */
{
    unsigned int        state = 0;
    Arg                 args[5];
    Cardinal            i = 0;
    XmDisplay           dd = (XmDisplay) XmGetXmDisplay(XtDisplay(dc));
 
/* INSERT */

        int dummyx, dummyy;
        Window protoWindow;
 
        (void) XTranslateCoordinates(XtDisplay(dc), dc->drag.currWmRoot,
                                     dc->drag.currWmRoot,
                                     ev->xbutton.x_root, ev->xbutton.y_root,
                                     &dummyx, &dummyy,
                                     &protoWindow);
 
        DragMotionProto( dc, dc->drag.currWmRoot, protoWindow );
    }
/* INSERT */

...

       i = 0;
       XtSetArg(args[i], XmNhotX, dc->core.x); i++;
       XtSetArg(args[i], XmNhotY, dc->core.y); i++;
       if (currentActiveMode == XmCURSOR ||
           (currentMode != XmDRAG_WINDOW && currentMode != XmWINDOW) ) {
/* INSERT */
         /*
          * We must move the drag over shell to the location where
          * the mouse button was released.  Otherwise the drag icon
          * will popup at the last location the window was used and
          * then move to the current location.  This causes flashing
          */
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNx, ev->xbutton.x_root); i++;
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNy, ev->xbutton.y_root); i++;
/* INSERT */
         XtSetArg(args[i], XmNdragOverMode, XmWINDOW); i++;
       }
       XtSetValues((Widget) dc->drag.curDragOver, args, i);

This last bit of code moves the dragover shell to the location of the button release.
It must be moved or else the dragover shell will be mapped into the old location and
the immediately moved to the new location.  This causes unnecessary flashing.
I've seen an X protocol error recently that is due to this code.  I'll look into it.  The
basic bug will be fixed without it but it would be nice to fix the flashing, too.

 Bug Id: 1221794
 Category: cde
 Subcategory: motif
 Bug/Rfe: bug
 State: integrated
 Synopsis: _XmConst is never really "const" and other data section bloat
 Keywords: bloat, section, data, "const", _xmconst, per-client, memory, wasting, -xstrconst, libs, cde
 Severity: 4
 Priority: 4
 Responsible Manager: jenks
 Responsible Engineer: hinkmond
 Description: 

The .data section in libXm is full of string data and other junk like x bitmaps
which could be made read-only and thus be shared across the desktop.  Part
of this problem stems from the fact that the _XmConst macro is never really
defined as anything useful by the time it gets into the code, no matter which
compile mode (-X[c|a|s|t) is used and what the value of __STDC__ is.

To demonstrate this use the following example:

---------------------------------
#include <Xm/XmP.h>

/*
 * Save as "foo.c"
 *
 * Compile as follows and examine the resulting
 * definition for the variable "FOO".  Vary the
 * -X? option.
 *
 * $ cc -Xc -E -c foo.c -I/usr/dt/include -I/usr/openwin/include | grep FOO
 */

static _XmConst char* FOO = "bar";
---------------------------------


The rest of the problem is that the code is littered with bitmap data
declarations, strings initialized to character arrays rather than pointers,
and miscellaneous static initializers which are not marked as "const"
even by way of the _XmConst macro.

These are the results of a prototype library I put together that const'izes
what it can.  Note that .data itself is brought down by ~90%!  (picdata is
something the new linter adds in, dunno how to fit that into the numbers
verses the FCS library):

# FCS 1.01 version
size -F /usr/dt/lib/libXm.so.3.orig 
1434478(r-x) + 133484(rwx) = 1567962

size -f /usr/dt/lib/libXm.so.3.orig
15260(.hash) + 30592(.dynsym) + 37427(.dynstr) + 75252(.rela.data) + 28440(.rela.got) + 12900(.rela.plt) + 1198156(.text) + 12(.init) + 12(.fini) + 424(.rodata) + 35854(.rodata1) + 9484(.got) + 152(.dynamic) + 12952(.plt) + 104428(.data) + 6468(.bss) = 1567813

# My constized version
size -F libXm.so.3.rmg
1518050(r-x) + 73824(rwx) = 1591874

size -f libXm.so.3.rmg
15268(.hash) + 30624(.dynsym) + 37345(.dynstr) + 24(.rela.ex_shared) + 14040(.rela.data) + 61212(.rela.picdata) + 20832(.rela.got) + 12900(.rela.plt) + 1242844(.text) + 56(.init) + 56(.fini) + 4(.exception_ranges) + 57130(.rodata) + 25558(.rodata1) + 6948(.got) + 152(.dynamic) + 12952(.plt) + 32(.ex_shared) + 12472(.data) + 34796(.picdata) + 6468(.bss) = 1591713

 Work around: 



 Suggested fix: 

In my proto library, I made the XtResource and XtActionsRec arrays const
in each of the widgets.  I believe that is a safe assumption.

Also, lookout for static tables, bitmaps and other stuff littered throughout
the code but declared somewhere in the middle of the file.

No problem - it was good to see you again too!

I've just been up to "Janta" in Palo Alto for a fine curry - lunch
buffet style.  Marvellous stuff.  The guy asked again if I'd been to
Burger King recently!

Yeah - I read about that on the internet (Electronic Telegraph) - it
said something about the Siberian weather front arriving in England!
It's nice and sunny here again, as usual.  Even though I hate the weeks
of dreary, dull, cloudy weather in England, I really do enjoy a crisp,
cold, sunny winter's day to take a walk in the English countryside -
something very refreshing about it.

Anyway, keep rolling those "liars dice", dude!

Whoopee.
My personal dtcm is 97 pages (yes, pages) smaller
with the new compiler!  So far it seems to work ok.
However, dtmail goes south on me whenever I do a compose
windo. John is looking into this.
Just thought you would like to know about the encouraging
numbers.

Whoops my mistake...Kevin take back what I said.  It's still good,
but not as good as I originally told you:

Total mapped sizes via ps:
New 1679 pages
Old 1700

I thought I launched a fresh dtcm, but apparently I did not...apologies.

John, 

Here are some thoughts on dtmail's performance using the new "backend".
Dtmail startup time will not change appreciably, except for the network
delay introduced if you are communicating to a remote IMAP server.
In both the local and remote cases, dtmail will still have to open and
parse the entire mailbox at startup.  The subsequent interaction with 
the mailbox (e.g. displaying messages) will be improved based on the 
low-bandwidth (fetch as needed) modifications being added.  We are also
including modifications to prevent the UI from hanging when doing
operations that might take an extended amount of time.  Such operations
are auto-save, opening a new mailbox, displaying a message, saving a
message, and perhaps a few others that I can't think of at the moment.
All of these operations will be implemented as asynchronous calls to
the backend of dtmail.

Thats all for now.

Well, it's that time of year again, almost. Time for a new Xsnow.
Xsnow is the X-windows application that will let it snow on the 
root, in between and on windows (really). Santa and his reindeer 
will complete your festive-season feeling. 

This year's update (version 1.40) consists of some minor fixes and 
one great big improvement in performance under certain circumstances. 
When using a solid color as the background Xsnow needs less than 30% 
of the original system resources in some cases. A background color is
chosen with the -bg option, the performance improvement is switched
on by specifying -solidbg. Example:

  xsnow -bg skyblue3 -solidbg

For notes on how to run Xsnow on HP and Silicon Graphics with desktop 
management see the README or the man page.

Xsnow is available directly from me via my WWW page:

  <URL:http://www.sara.nl/Rick.Jansen>

Click on the appropriate item and the tar file will be downloaded
upon your request.

Xsnow is available freely and you may give it to other people as is,
but I retain all rights. Therefore it does not classify as 'Public
Domain' software.

Happy X-mas!

Get as active as possible to promote data locality.
We have potential for a big win if we can reduce the memory
range of 'mega'data sweeps.

The slab allocator or something similiar may be appropriate.
Don't be afraid to be a contructive 'nag'.

First time users of the Netscape browser may have experienced a problem 
with the automatic set-up of the .netscape-preferences file. 

An error message about: 

      /usr/dist/local/pkgs/lib/nameslistx missing

appeared when the "creating preferences" popup appears.

The netscape wrapper was trying to reference /usr/dist/local/lib/nameslistx
when it should have been /usr/dist/pkgs/lib/nameslistx.

This problem has been fixed.  Sorry for any inconvenience this may have caused.

Here are the results of the two dtmail performance fixes that I've implemented.
In the experiments below, dtmail was started with a mailbox of ~500 messages,
3 were deleted, and then dtmail was exited.

XmTextReplace calls have been reduced to one each time you display a message.
XmStringCreateLocalized calls have been cut almost in half for each header that
is created.  XmStringFree and XmStringConcat calls have also been significantly
reduced.

This improvement seen with the XmStrings is directly proportional to the number
of messages in your mailbox.  This is tnf output, I won't be able to get a
real feel for the actual performance improvement until I've run it on cdebench.

Hi All:   FYI I will be moving on 12/12 - 12/13 
	to a new cube (#4261) outside Mackay old office.

	Which means, I will be "down" from 3PM 12/12 to
	and also 12/13 while they move me.

	See me by tomorrow, Friday 12/8 if you have any 
	urgent requests.

	Thanks,

	Linda

I just realized that we don't seem to compile code with NDEBUG defined.

This means that code which uses assert(3) will actual be shipped with
live assert code.  Compiling with NDEBUG essentially "comments out" all
assertions.

Do we want to be shipping assert-enabled code, or should we just be
using it as a development/debugging aid?

I have been informed that there is a black Mustang in the Mountain View

This car is not in the "lights" database.

Thank you,

Unsure of you could answer with a quick fix:

Here is the problem I am getting with Netscape:

ld.so.1: netscape: fatal: libXm.so.3: can't open file: errno=2
Killed

I've looked around and a friend finally pointed me to 

   /lab/motif/usr/lib

which I mount from zinfandel.
But this on my LD_LIBRARY_PATH is still insufficient
perhaps because that directory only has libXm.so.2.12 (?)

Help?

Thanks!

The numbers look very good.

I just ran a similar dtmail experiment (deleting 3 messages) under
gprof- I've appended the top numbers.  24.7% of all time was spent in
Scan(), which is listed as <spontaneous>, meaning it wasn't directly
called by libXm.  It might be interesting for me to see how this changes
if I use your fixed dtmail.  Where can I find it?

The full gprof listing is in:
