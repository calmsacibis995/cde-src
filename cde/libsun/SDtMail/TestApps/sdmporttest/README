# @(#)README	1.1 96/07/24 SMI

This README describes how to create and use the sdmporttest scripts.

Requirements
------------

1. An IMAP4 server must be available on the test machine.  The latest IMAP4
   server may be obtained from:
     /net/mcm-home/export/pkgs/imapd/latest/sparc   and
     /net/mcm-home/export/pkgs/imapd/latest/x86

2. The test machine must provide the following user account (necessary for
   IMAP4 access):
     username: imaptest
     password: imaptestpassword


Naming conventions
------------------

  *.src	  Test sources
  *L.tst  Generated "local" test scripts
  *I.tst  Generated "imap" test scripts
  *.mbx   Test mailboxes


Test generation and execution
-----------------------------

The automatic generation of the tests is achieved by issuing the command
`make cclient_tests'.  The details of how this works are described below.

The tests are then executed by providing the test script as input to the
sdmporttest program, eg. ./sdmporttest < getheadersL.tst


Test synopses
-------------

commitpending.src	Commits a new message to a store
copymove.src		Exercises copy and move operations
getattributes.src	Fetches attributes eg. name, boundary
getcontents.src		Fetching message contents
getcontentsV3.src	Fetches contents of a V3 message
getflags.src		Fetches and clears various flags
getheaders.src		Fetches headers - real, pseudo and indirect styles
scan.src		Tests scan and scansubscribed commands
setup.src		Common "init" file #included by *.src
submitaudatt.src	Submits a MP message with an audio attachment
submitaudbdy.src	Submits a audio message in a single body
submitnstatt.src	Submits a message with (multiply) nested attachments


How it works
------------

For each test source, 2 test scripts are automatically generated using the C
preprocessor (/usr/ccs/lib/cpp).  This is in order to accommodate "local"
and "imap" flavors of each test where essentially the "bulk" of the test
script is the same in both cases.

The following preprocessor conditionals are currently supported:

 IMAP 
   Specifies that the generated test script will connect to an IMAP4
   server as opposed to accessing the mailbox locally.

 LOGNAME
   Specifies the user's login name - this is used as the value for the "To:"
   header in tests which exercise sending email.

 HOSTNAME
   Specifies the host on which the IMAP4 server resides.  This host must be
   the same host on which the test is executed, since the /tmp directory is
   used as a shared repository between server and client tests.

Note that the Imakefile automatically sets appropriate values for the above
conditionals when the test scripts are generated.
