.SH NAME
dtpmfile \- format of X Pixmap (XPM) format desktop icon files
.SH SYNOPSIS

    /* XPM */
    static char * \f2icon_name\f1[] = {
    "\f2width height num_colors chars_per_pixel [x_hot y_hot]\f1",
    "\f2char {key color}+\f1",
    ...
    " \f2pixels\f1 ",
    ...
    };

.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Pixmap icons are multi-color images based on the XPM (X PixMap) format 
developed by Arnaud Le Hors. A pixmap file is an ascii file which can 
be read and modified by hand, in addition to the use of color pixmap 
editors (like the Icon Editor). The XPM format was designed specifically 
for small "icon" images. XPM files can be included directly in C source 
code, so the file data is in the form of a pixmap structure variable. 
A pixmap file can be broken down into three main components: generic 
pixmap information, pixmap colors, and the actual pixmap data.  

The generic pixmap file contains the following information:

.LI
\(bu
pixmap name
.br
\(bu
pixmap width
.br
\(bu
pixmap height
.br
\(bu
number of colors used in pixmap
.br
\(bu
number of characters per pixel
.br
\(bu
x hot-spot and y hot-spot (optional)
.LE

Each color used in the pixmap is defined by a string containing the 
following information:

.LI
\(bu
character(s) used to represent this color in pixmap data
.br
\(bu
symbolic name for this color
.br
\(bu
mono visual to use for this color (i.e. black/white)
.br
\(bu
color visual by name ("red") or RGB value ("#9696c8c8afaf")
.br
\(bu
gray scale visuals (most CDE icons do not include gray scale data)
.LE

The data itself is simply strings of symbols representing colors. 
There is one string per column of the pixmap, and this data will 
resemble the actual icon.

More detailed information on the XPM library API and file format is
available with the XPM package from Arnaud Le Hors.

For documentation on the XPM Library, questions, suggestions, etc., you 
can send electronic mail to lehors@sophia.inria.fr. There is an email 
group to discuss XPM issues which you can subscribe to by writing to 
xpm-talk-request@sophia.inria.fr. The latest release, along with an archive 
of the mailing list, is available by anonymous ftp on avahi.inria.fr 
(138.96.24.30) or export.lcs.mit.edu (18.30.0.238).

.SH "RETURN VALUE"
None.

.SH EXAMPLES

The following is a pixmap which could be used to represent an executable 
file.  The icon has a 3-D border around it and contains a lightning bolt.
