.SH NAME
\fIdtwm\fP \- The Common Desktop Environment Window Manager
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.sS
\fIdtwm\fP [ \fBoptions\fP ]
.sE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.fi
\fIdtwm\fP
is an X Window System window manager based upon the OSF/Motif window
manager, \fImwm\fP (version 1.2.3). It provides \fImwm\fP compatible 
window management functionality.  This includes functions that 
facilitate control (by the user and the programmer) of elements of window
state such as placement, size, icon/normal display, and input-focus ownership.
.P
\fIdtwm\fP is an integral part of the
Common Desktop Environment (CDE). It communicates with and facilitates access
to other components in the environment, such as the Session Manager
(\fIdtsession (1)\fP) and the Style Manager (\fIdtstyle (1)\fP). Many
other components are started through interactions with the Front Panel.
.P
In addition, \fIdtwm\fP provides workspace management. Workspaces
provide a way of grouping together logically related windows. Each 
workspace is shown independent of the other workspaces so that only
those windows related to the immediate task are visible. Workspaces give
you a tool to organize windows by task and make efficient use of screen
real estate.
.P
.SS Options
.IP "\fI\-display\fP\ \fBdisplay\fP"
This option specifies the display to use; see \fBX(1)\fP.
.IP "\fI\-xrm\fP\ \fBresourcestring\fP"
This option specifies a resource string to use.
.IP "\fI\-multiscreen\fP"
This option causes \fIdtwm\fP to manage all screens on the display.
Since \fIdtwm\fP does this by default, this option is of limited use. 
See the \fImultiScreen\fP resource for information on managing a
single screen.
.IP "\fI\-name\fP\ \fBname\fP"
This option causes \fIdtwm\fP to retrieve its resources using the
specified name, as in \fBname*resource\fP.
.IP "\fI\-screens\fP\ \fBname\ [name\ [...]]\fP"
This option specifies the resource names to use for the screens managed
by \fIdtwm\fP.
If \fIdtwm\fP is managing a single screen, only the first name in the
list is used.
If \fIdtwm\fP is managing multiple screens, the names are assigned to the
screens in order, starting with screen 0.
Screen 0 gets the first name, screen 1 the second name, and so on.
.SS Startup
Normally, the session manager \fIdtsession\fP starts up \fIdtwm\fP. 
You can alter the command line for the window manager via the
wmStartupCommand resource for the session manager 
(see \fIdtsession (1)\fP). Similarly, you can
affect the behavior of \fIdtwm\fP by saving resources for \fIdtwm\fP as
part of your session.
.SS Appearance
The following sections describe the basic default behaviors of windows,
icons, the icon box, input focus, and window stacking.  The appearance and
behavior of the window manager can be altered by changing the configuration
of specific resources.  Resources are defined under the heading "X DEFAULTS."
.SS Screens
By default, \fIdtwm\fP manages only the single screen specified by the
\fI\-display\fP option or the DISPLAY environment variable (by default,
screen 0).
If the \fI\-multiscreen\fP option is specified or if the
\fImultiScreen\fP resource is True, \fIdtwm\fP tries to manage all the
screens on the display.
.PP 
When \fIdtwm\fP is managing multiple screens, the \fI\-screens\fP option
can be used to give each screen a unique resource name.
The names are separated by blanks, for example, \fI\-screens\fP scr0 scr1.
If there are more screens than names, resources for the remaining
screens will be retrieved using the first name.
By default, the screen number is used for the screen name.
.nL
.ne 15
.SS Windows
Default \fIdtwm\fP window frames have distinct components with associated 
functions:
.IP "\fITitle\ Area\fP"
In addition to displaying the client's title, the title area is used to
move the
window.  To move the window, place the pointer over the title area, press
button 1 and drag the window to a new location.  
By default, a wire frame is moved
during the drag to indicate the new location.
When the button is released,
the window is moved to the new location.
.IP "\fITitle\ Bar\fP"
The title bar includes the title area, the minimize button, the maximize
button, and the window menu button.
In shaped windows, such as round windows, the title bar floats above
the window.
.IP "\fIMinimize\ Button\fP"
To turn the window into an icon, click button 1 on the minimize
button (the frame box with a \fBsmall\fP square in it).
.IP "\fIMaximize\ Button\fP"
To make the window fill the screen (or enlarge to the largest size allowed
by the configuration files), click button 1 on the maximize button
(the frame box with a \fBlarge\fP square in it).
.IP "\fIWindow\ Menu\ Button\fP"
The window menu button is the frame box with a horizontal bar in it.
To pull down the window menu, press button 1.
While pressing, drag the pointer on the menu to your selection, then
release the button when your selection is highlighted.
Pressing button 3 in the title bar or resize border handles also
posts the window menu.
Alternately, you can click button 1 to pull down the menu and keep
it posted; then position the pointer and select.
You can also post the window menu by pressing
<Shift>
<Esc>
or
<Alt>
<Space>.
Double-clicking button 1 with the pointer on the window menu button
closes the window.
The following table lists the contents of the window menu.

.IP "\fIResize\ Border\ Handles\fP"
To change the size of a window, move the pointer over a resize border
handle (the cursor changes), press button 1, and drag the window to a
new size.  When the button is released, the window is resized.  While
dragging is being done, a rubber-band outline is displayed to indicate the
new window size.
.IP "\fIMatte\fP"
An optional matte decoration can be added between the client area and the
window frame (see the matteWidth resource).  A matte is not actually part 
of the window frame.  There is no functionality associated with a matte.
.SS Icons
Icons are small graphic representations of windows.  A window can be
minimized (iconified) using the minimize button on the window frame.
Icons provide a way to reduce clutter on the screen.
.PP 
.ne 6
Pressing mouse button 1 when the pointer is over an icon
causes the icon's window menu to pop up.  Releasing the button (press +
release without moving mouse = click) causes the menu to stay posted.

Note that pressing button 3 over an icon also causes the
icon's window menu to pop up.
To make a menu selection, drag the pointer over
the menu and release button 3 when the desired item is highlighted.
.PP 
Double-clicking button 1 on an icon invokes the \fIf.restore_and_raise\fP
function and restores the icon's associated window to its previous state.
For example, if a maximized window is iconified, then
double-clicking button 1 restores it to its maximized state.  
Double-clicking button 1 on the icon box's icon opens the icon box and
allows access to the contained icons.  (In general,
double-clicking a mouse button is a quick way to perform a function.)
Pressing
<Shift>
<Esc>
or
<Menu>
(the pop-up menu key)
causes the icon window menu of the currently selected icon to pop up.
.SS "Icon Box"
When icons begin to clutter the screen, they can be packed into an icon
box.  (To use an icon box, \fIdtwm\fP must be started with the icon box
configuration already set.)
The icon box is a \fIdtwm\fP window that holds client
icons.
It includes one or more scroll bars when there are more window icons
than the icon box can show at the same time.
.PP 
.ne 2i
Icons in the icon box can be manipulated with the mouse.
The following table summarizes the behavior of this interface.  Button
actions apply whenever the pointer
.ne 4
is on any part of the icon.
Note that double-clicking an icon in the icon box invokes the
\fIf.restore_and_raise\fP function.

To pull down the window menu for the icon box itself,
press button 1 with the pointer
over the menu button for the
icon box.
The window menu of the icon box
differs from the window menu of a client
window: The "Close"
selection is replaced with the "PackIcons Shift+Alt+F7" selection.
When selected,
PackIcons packs the icons in the box to achieve
neat rows with no empty slots.
.PP

You can also post the window menu by pressing
<Shift>
<Esc>
or
<Alt>
<Space>.
Pressing
<Menu>
(the pop-up menu key)
causes the
icon window menu of the currently selected icon to pop up.
.SS "Input Focus"
\fIdtwm\fP supports (by default) a keyboard input focus policy of explicit selection.
This means when a window is selected to get keyboard input, it continues to
get keyboard input until the window is withdrawn from window management,
another window is explicitly selected to get keyboard input, or the window
is iconified.  Several resources control the input focus.
The client window with the keyboard input focus has the
active window appearance with a
visually distinct window frame.

.SS "Window Stacking"
There are two types of window stacks:  global window stacks
and an application's local family window stack.
.P
The global stacking order of windows may be changed as a result of
setting the keyboard input focus, iconifying a window, or performing
a window manager window stacking function.  When keyboard focus policy
is explicit the default value of the \fIfocusAutoRaise\fP resource is
True.  This causes a window to be raised to the top of the stack when
it receives input focus, for example, by pressing button 1 on the title
bar.  The key actions defined in the previous table will thus raise
the window receiving focus to the top of the stack.  
.P
In pointer mode, the default value of \fIfocusAutoRaise\fP is False,
that is, the window stacking order is not changed when a window
receives keyboard input focus.  The following key actions can be used
to cycle through the global window stack.

.sp 1
.P
By default, a window's icon is placed on the bottom of the
stack when the window is iconified; however, the default can be changed
by the \fIlowerOnIconify\fP resource.
.P
Transient windows (secondary windows such a dialog boxes) stay
above their parent windows by default.  However, an application's local
family stacking order may be changed to allow a transient window to be
placed below its parent top-level window.  The following parameters show
the modification of the stacking order for the \fIf.lower\fP function.
.P 
.IP "\fIf.lower\fP"
Lowers the transient window within the family (staying above the parent)
and lowers the family in the global window stack.
.IP "\fIf.lower\fP\ [\fIwithin\fP]"
Lowers the transient window within the family (staying above the parent) but 
does not lower the family in the global window stack.
.IP "\fIf.lower\fP\ [\fIfreeFamily\fP]"
Lowers the window free from its family stack (below the parent), but
does not lower the family in the global window stack.
.P
The parameters \fIwithin\fP and \fIfreeFamily\fP can also be used with 
\fIf.raise\fP and \fIf.raise_lower\fP.
.SS "X Resources"
\fIdtwm\fP is configured from its resource database.
This database is built from the following sources. They are listed in order of
precedence, low to high:
.P 
/usr/dt/app-defaults/$LANG/Dtwm
.br
$HOME/Dtwm
.br
RESOURCE_MANAGER root window property or $HOME/.Xdefaults
.br
XENVIRONMENT variable or $HOME/.Xdefaults-\fBhost\fP
.br
\fIdtwm\fP command line options
.P 
The file names /usr/dt/app-defaults/$LANG/Dtwm and $HOME/Dtwm represent
customary locations for these files.
The actual location of the system-wide class resource file may depend
on the XFILESEARCHPATH environment variable and the current language
environment.
The actual location of the user-specific class resource file may depend
on the XUSERFILESEARCHPATH and XAPPLRESDIR environment variables and the
current language environment.
.PP 
Entries in the resource database may refer to other resource files
for specific types of resources.
These include files that contain bitmaps, fonts, and \fIdtwm\fP
specific resources such as menus and behavior specifications
(for example, button and key bindings).
.PP 
\fIDtwm\fP is the resource class name of \fIdtwm\fP
and \fIdtwm\fP is the default resource
name used by \fIdtwm\fP to look up resources.
the \fI\-screens\fP command line option
specifies resource names, such as "dtwm_b+w" and "dtwm_color".)
In the following discussion of resource specification,
"Dtwm" and "dtwm" (and
the aliased \fIdtwm\fP resource names) can be used interchangeably,
but "dtwm" takes precedence over "Dtwm".
.PP 
\fIdtwm\fP uses the following types of resources:
.PP 
\fBComponent Appearance Resources:\fP
.PP 
These resources specify appearance attributes of
window manager user interface components.
They can be applied to the appearance of window manager menus,
feedback windows (for example, the window reconfiguration feedback window),
client window frames, and icons.
.PP 
\fBGeneral Appearance and Behavior Resources:\fP
.PP 
These resources specify \fIdtwm\fP appearance and
behavior (for example, window management policies).
They are not set separately for different \fIdtwm\fP user interface 
components. They apply to all screens and workspaces.
.PP 
.ne 4i
\fBScreen Specific Appearance and Behavior Resources:\fP
.PP 
These resources specify the appearance and
behavior of \fIdtwm\fP elements that are settable on a per-screen
basis.
.PP 
.ne 4i
\fBClient Specific Resources:\fP
.PP 
These \fIdtwm\fP resources can be set for a particular client window or
class of client windows.
They specify client-specific icon and client window frame
appearance and behavior.
.PP 
.ne 4i
\fBWorkspace Specific Resources:\fP
.PP 
These resources specify the appearance of \fIdtwm\fP elements that 
are settable on a per-workspace basis .
.PP
.ne 6
Resource identifiers can be either a resource name (for example, foreground)
or a resource
class (for example, Foreground).
If the value of a resource is a filename and if the filename is
prefixed by "~/", then it is relative to the path contained in the HOME
environment variable
(generally the user's home directory).
.SS "Component Appearance Resources"
The syntax for specifying component appearance resources that apply
to window manager icons, menus, and client window frames is
.P 
.na
.wH .in +5n 
\fIDtwm*\fBresource_id\fP
.wH .in -5n 
.ad
.P 
For example, \fIDtwm*foreground\fP is used to specify the foreground color
for \fIdtwm\fP menus, icons, client window frames, and feedback dialogs.
.PP 
The syntax for specifying component appearance resources that apply
to a particular \fIdtwm\fP component is
.P 
.na
.wH .in +5n 
\fIDtwm*\fP[\fImenu\fP|\fIicon\fP|\fIclient\fP|\fIfeedback\fP]\fI*\fBresource_id\fP
.wH .in -5n 
.ad
.PP 
If \fBmenu\fP is specified, the resource is applied only to \fIdtwm\fP
menus; if \fBicon\fP is specified, the resource is applied to icons;
and if \fBclient\fP is specified, the resource is applied to
client window frames.
For example, \fIDtwm*icon*foreground\fP is used to specify the foreground color
for \fIdtwm\fP icons, \fIDtwm*menu*foreground\fP specifies the foreground color
for \fIdtwm\fP menus, and \fIDtwm*client*foreground\fP is used to specify the
foreground color for \fIdtwm\fP client window frames.
.PP 
The appearance of the title area of a client window frame
(including window management buttons)
can be separately configured.
The syntax for configuring the title area of a client window frame is
.PP 
.wH .in +4 
\fIDtwm*client*title*\fBresource_id\fP
.wH .in -4 
.PP 
For example, \fIDtwm*client*title*foreground\fP specifies the foreground color
for the title area.
Defaults for title area resources are based on the values of the
corresponding client window frame resources.
.PP 
.ne 6
The appearance of menus can be configured based on the name of the menu.
The syntax for specifying menu appearance by name is
.PP 
.wH .in +4 
\fIDtwm*menu*\fBmenu_name\fI*\fBresource_id\fP
.wH .in -4 
.PP 
For example, \fIDtwm*menu*my_menu*foreground\fP specifies the foreground color
for the menu named \fImy_menu\fP.
The user can also specify resources for window manager menu components,
that is, the gadgets which comprise the menu.  These may include for example,
a menu title, title separator, one or more buttons, and separators.  If a
menu contains more than one instance of a class, such as multiple
PushButtonGadgets, the name of the first instance is "PushButtonGadget1",
the second is "PushButtonGadget2", and so on.  The following list identifies
the naming convention used for window manager menu components:
.TP
\(bu
Menu Title LabelGadget \- "TitleName"
.TP
\(bu
Menu Title SeparatorGadget \- "TitleSeparator"
.TP
\(bu
CascadeButtonGadget \- "CascadeButtonGadget<n>"
.TP
\(bu
PushButtonGadget \- "PushButtonGadget<n>"
.TP
\(bu
SeparatorGadget \- "SeparatorGadget<n>"
.P
Refer to the man page for each class for a list of resources
which can be specified.

.wH .in  
.IP "\fIautoKeyFocus\fP\ (class\ \fIAutoKeyFocus\fP)"
This resource is available only when the keyboard input
focus policy is explicit.  If autoKeyFocus is given a value of
True, then when a window with the keyboard input focus is withdrawn from
window management or is iconified, the focus is set to the previous window
.ne 4
that had the focus.  If the value given is False, there is no
automatic setting of the keyboard input focus.  
It is recommended that both \fIautoKeyFocus\fP and \fIstartupKeyFocus\fP
be True to work with tear off menus.  The default value is True.
.IP "\fIautoRaiseDelay\fP\ (class\ \fIAutoRaiseDelay\fP)"
This resource is available only when the focusAutoRaise resource is True
and the keyboard focus policy is pointer.
The autoRaiseDelay resource specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds)
that \fIdtwm\fP
will wait before raising a window after it gets the keyboard focus.
The default value of this resource is 500 (ms).
.IP "\fIbackdropDirectories\fP\ (class\ \fIBackdropDirectories\fP)"
This resource identifies a colon-separated list of directories to
be searched to find backdrop files. This resource is shared with the
style manager (\fIdtstyle\fP). It normally appears in the resource 
database unqualified by application as "*backdropDirectories" so that both
\fIdtwm\fP and \fIdtstyle\fP pick up the same value.
The default value for this resource is /etc/dt/backdrops. Note that
this default directory will always be added to the end of the search
path if it is not included to guarantee a base set of backdrops is
available.
.IP "\fIbitmapDirectory\fP\ (class\ \fIBitmapDirectory\fP)"
This resource identifies a directory to be searched for bitmaps
referenced by \fIdtwm\fP resources.
This directory is searched if a bitmap is specified without an absolute
pathname.
The default value for this resource is /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.
The directory /usr/include/X11/bitmaps represents the
customary locations for this directory.
The actual location of this directory may vary on some systems.
If the bitmap is not found in the specified directory, XBMLANGPATH is searched.
.IP "\fIclientAutoPlace\fP\ (class\ \fIClientAutoPlace\fP)"
This resource determines the
position of a window when the window has not been given a
program- or
user-specified
position.  With a value of True, windows are positioned with the top
left corners of the frames offset horizontally and vertically.  A value of
False causes the currently configured
.ne 4
position of the window to be
used.  In either case, \fIdtwm\fP will attempt to place the windows totally on-screen.
The default value is True.
.IP "\fIcolormapFocusPolicy\fP\ (class\ \fIColormapFocusPolicy\fP)"
This resource indicates the colormap focus policy that is to be used.
If the resource value is explicit, a colormap selection action
is done on a client window to set the colormap focus to that window.
If the value is pointer, the client window containing
the pointer has the colormap focus.
If the value is keyboard, the client window that has the
keyboard input focus has the colormap focus.
The default value for this resource is keyboard.
.IP "\fIconfigFile\fP\ (class\ \fIConfigFile\fP)"
The resource value is the pathname for an \fIdtwm\fP
resource description file.
.sp 1
If the pathname begins with "~/", \fIdtwm\fP considers it to be relative 
to the user's home directory (as specified by the HOME environment variable).
If the LANG environment variable is set, \fIdtwm\fP looks for
$HOME/$LANG/\fBconfigFile\fP.
If that file does not exist or if LANG is not set, \fIdtwm\fP looks for
$HOME/\fBconfigFile\fP.
.sp 1
If the \fIconfigFile\fP pathname does not begin with "~/" or "/", \fIdtwm\fP 
considers it to be relative to the current working directory.
.sp 1
If the \fIconfigFile\fP resource is not specified or if that file does
not exist, \fIdtwm\fP uses several default paths to find a configuration file.
The order of the search is shown below:
.sp 1
$HOME/.dt/$LANG/dtwmrc

Paths marked with '\(dg' are implementation dependent.
.IP "\fIdeiconifyKeyFocus\fP\ (class\ \fIDeiconifyKeyFocus\fP)"
This resource applies only
when the keyboard input focus policy is explicit.  If a value of
True is used, a window receives the keyboard input focus when it is
normalized (deiconified).  True is the default value.
.IP "\fIdoubleClickTime\fP\ (class\ \fIDoubleClickTime\fP)"
This resource is used to set the maximum time (in ms) between the clicks
(button presses) that make up a double-click.
The use of this resource is deprecated. Use the Xt resource
\fImultiClickTime\fP instead. The value of \fIdoubleClickTime\fP
dynamically defaults to the value of \fImultiClickTime\fP.
.IP "\fIenableWarp\fP\ (class\ \fIEnableWarp\fP)"
The default value of this resource, True, causes \fIdtwm\fP to warp
the pointer to the center of
the selected window during keyboard-controlled resize and
move operations.  Setting the value to False causes \fIdtwm\fP to leave
the pointer at its original place on the screen, unless the
user explicitly moves it with the cursor keys or pointing device.
.IP "\fIenforceKeyFocus\fP\ (class\ \fIEnforceKeyFocus\fP)"
If this resource is given a value of True,
the keyboard input focus is always explicitly set to selected windows
even if there is an indication that they are "globally active" input
windows.  (An example of a globally active window is a scroll bar that
can be operated without setting the focus to that client.)  If the resource
is False, the keyboard input focus is not
explicitly set to globally active windows.
The default value is True.
.IP "\fIframeStyle\fP\ (class\ \fIframeStyle\fP)"
If this resource is given a value of "slab",
the the window manager frame is drawn such that the client area appears
to be at the same height as the top of the window frame.  If the resource 
is set to "recessed", the window frame is drawn such that the 
client area appears lower than the top of the window frame.
The default value is "recessed".
.IP "\fIiconAutoPlace\fP\ (class\ \fIIconAutoPlace\fP)"
This resource indicates whether the window manager arranges icons in a
particular area of the screen or places each icon where the window was
when it was iconified.
The value True indicates that icons are arranged in a particular area of
the screen, determined by the iconPlacement resource.
The value False indicates that an icon is placed at the location of the
window when it is iconified.
The default is True.
.IP "\fIiconClick\fP\ (class\ \fIIconClick\fP)"
When this resource is given the value of
True, the system menu is posted and left posted when an icon is
clicked.  
The default value is True.
.IP "\fIinteractivePlacement\fP\ (class\ \fIInteractivePlacement\fP)"
This resource controls the initial placement of new windows on the screen.
If the value is True, the pointer shape changes before a new window is
placed on the screen to indicate to the user that
a position should be selected for the upper-left hand corner of the
window.
If the value is False, windows are placed according to the
initial window configuration attributes.
The default value of this resource is False.
.IP "\fIkeyboardFocusPolicy\fP\ (class\ \fIKeyboardFocusPolicy\fP)"
If set to pointer, the keyboard focus policy is to have the keyboard focus set
to the client window that contains the pointer
(the pointer could also be in the client window decoration that \fIdtwm\fP adds).
If set to explicit, the policy is to have the keyboard focus
set to a client window when the user presses button 1 with the pointer
on the client window or any part of the associated \fIdtwm\fP decoration.
The default value for this resource is explicit.
.IP "\fIlowerOnIconify\fP\ (class\ \fILowerOnIconify\fP)"
If this resource is given the default
value of True, a window's icon appears on the bottom of the window
stack when the window is minimized (iconified).  A value of False
places the icon in the stacking order at the same place as its associated
window.
The default value of this resource is True.
.IP "\fImarqueeSelectGranularity\fP\ (class\ \fIMarqueeSelectGranularity\fP)"
This resource determines how often changes in the marquee selection 
are reported to the file manager (\fIdtfile (1)\fP). The marquee
selection is used to select file manager items that have been placed
onto the desktop. The value of this resource is the number of pixels the
pointer must move either horizontally or vertically before another
report is made to the file manager. A value of 0 (zero) means report every
motion of the pointer.
The default value of this resource is 0.
.IP "\fImoveThreshold\fP\ (class\ \fIMoveThreshold\fP)"
This resource is used to control the sensitivity of dragging operations
that move windows and icons.
The value of this resource is the number of pixels that the locator is
moved with a button down before the move operation is initiated.
This is used to prevent window/icon
.ne 3
movement when you click or
double-click and there is unintentional pointer movement with
the button down.
The default value of this resource is 4 (pixels).
.IP "\fImultiScreen\fP\ (class\ \fIMultiScreen\fP)"
This resource, if True, causes \fIdtwm\fP to manage all the screens on
the display.
If False, \fIdtwm\fP manages only a single screen.
The default value is True.
.IP "\fIpassButtons\fP\ (class\ \fIPassButtons\fP)"
This resource indicates whether or not button press events are passed to
clients after they are used to do a window manager function in the client
context.
If the resource value is False, the button press is not passed
to the client.
If the value is True, the button press is passed to the
client window.
The window manager function is done in either case.
The default value for this resource is False.
.IP "\fIpassSelectButton\fP\ (class\ \fIPassSelectButton\fP)"
This resource indicates whether or not to pass the select button press events
to clients after they are used to do a window manager function in the
client context.  If the resource value is False, then the button press will
not be passed to the client.  If the value is True, the button press is
passed to the client window.  The window manager function is done in either
case.  The default value for this resource is True.
.IP "\fIpositionIsFrame\fP\ (class\ \fIPositionIsFrame\fP)"
This resource indicates how client window position information
(from the WM_NORMAL_HINTS property and from configuration requests)
is to be interpreted.
If the resource value is True, the information is interpreted as
the position of the \fIdtwm\fP client window frame.  If the value is False,
it is interpreted as being the position of the client area of the window.
The default value of this resource is True.
.IP "\fIpositionOnScreen\fP\ (class\ \fIPositionOnScreen\fP)"
This resource is used to indicate that windows should initially be
placed (if possible) so that they are not clipped by the edge of the
screen (if the resource value is True).
If a window is larger than the size of the screen,
at least the upper-left corner of the window is on-screen.
If the resource value is False, windows are placed in the
requested position even if totally off-screen.
The default value of this resource is True.
.IP "\fIquitTimeout\fP\ (class\ \fIQuitTimeout\fP)"
This resource specifies the amount of time (in milliseconds) that \fIdtwm\fP
will wait for a client to update the WM_COMMAND property after \fIdtwm\fP has
sent the WM_SAVE_YOURSELF message.
The default value of this resource is 1000 (ms). (Refer to the f.kill
function description for additional information.)
.IP "\fIraiseKeyFocus\fP\ (class\ \fIRaiseKeyFocus\fP)"
This resource is available
only when the keyboard input focus policy is explicit.
When set to True,
this resource specifies that a window raised by
means of the f.normalize_and_raise function also receives
the input focus.
The default value of this resource is False.
.IP "\fIrefreshByClearing\fP\ (class\ \fIRefreshByClearing\fP)"
This resource determines the mechanism used to refresh a window (or
the screen) when the f.refresh_win (f.refresh) function is
executed. When set to True, an XClearArea is performed over 
the window for f.refresh_win. When set to False, a covering window
is created and destroyed over the top of the window to be refreshed.
If the function is f.refresh and this resource is set to True, then
an XClearArea is performed over every window on the screen. If the 
resource is set to False, then one large window covering the entire 
screen is created and destroyed.
The default value of this resource is True.
.IP "\fIrootButtonClick\fP\ (class\ \fIRootButtonClick\fP)"
The rootButtonClick resource controls whether the a click on the root
window will post the root menu in a "sticky" mode. If this 
resource is set to True, a button click 
on the root window will post the menu bound to the button down event for
that button in a "sticky" fashion. If this resource is set to False, then 
the same button click would only cause the menu to flash as it would 
be unposted once the button up event is seen.  The criterion used to 
determine if it is a button click is if the pointer doesn't move between
the button down and button up events.
The default value for this resource is True.
.IP "\fIscreens\fP\ (class\ \fIScreens\fP)"
This resource specifies the resource names to use for the screens
managed by \fIdtwm\fP.
If \fIdtwm\fP is managing a single screen, only the first name in the
list is used.
If \fIdtwm\fP is managing multiple screens, the names are assigned to the
screens in order, starting with screen 0.
Screen 0 gets the first name, screen 1 the second name, and so on.
The default screen names are 0, 1, and so on.
.nL

.IP "\fIshowFeedback\fP\ (class\ \fIShowFeedback\fP)"
This resource controls whether or not feedback windows or confirmation dialogs 
are displayed.  A feedback window shows a client window's initial
placement and shows position and size during move and resize 
operations.  Confirmation dialogs can be displayed for certain operations.
.sp 1
The
value for this resource is a list of names of the feedback options to be
enabled or disabled; the names must be separated by a space.
If an option is preceded by a minus sign, that option is
excluded from the list.
The \fBsign\fP of the first item in the list
determines the initial set of options.
If the sign of the first
option is minus, \fIdtwm\fP assumes all options are present and starts
subtracting from that set.
If the sign of the first decoration is plus (or not
specified), \fIdtwm\fP starts with no options and builds up a list from
the resource.

This resource enables the display of the front panel if True.
If set to False, the Front Panel will not be displayed.
The default value is True.
.IP "\fIstartupKeyFocus\fP\ (class\ \fIStartupKeyFocus\fP)"
This resource is available only
when the keyboard input focus policy is explicit.  When given
the default
value of True, a window gets the keyboard input focus when the window
is mapped (that is, initially managed by the window manager).
It is recommended that both \fIautoKeyFocus\fP and \fIstartupKeyFocus\fP
be True to work with tear off menus.  The default value is True.
.IP "\fIwMenuButtonClick\fP\ (class\ \fIWMenuButtonClick\fP)"

.IP "\fIbuttonBindings\fP\ (class\ \fIButtonBindings\fP)"
This resource identifies the set of button bindings
for window management functions.
The named set of button bindings is specified in the
\fIdtwm\fP resource description file.
These button bindings are \fBmerged\fP with the built-in default
bindings.
The default value for this resource is "DefaultButtonBindings".
.IP "\fIcleanText\fP\ (class\ \fICleanText\fP)"
This resource controls the display of window manager text in the client
title and feedback windows.
If the default value of True is used, the text is drawn with a clear (no
stipple) background.  This makes text easier to read on monochrome systems
where a backgroundPixmap is specified. Only the stippling in the area
immediately around the text is cleared.  If False, the text is drawn
directly on top of the existing background.
.IP "\fIfadeNormalIcon\fP\ (class\ \fIFadeNormalIcon\fP)"
If this resource is given a
value of True, an icon is grayed out whenever it has been normalized
(its window has been opened).  The default value is False.
.IP "\fIfeedbackGeometry\fP\ (class\ \fIFeedbackGeometry\fP)"
This resource sets the position of the move and resize feedback window.
If this resource is not specified, the default is to place the feedback
window at the center of the screen.
The value of the resource is a standard window geometry string with the
following syntax:
.sp 1
[\fI=\fP]{\fI+-\fP}\fBxoffset\fP{\fI+-\fP}\fByoffset\fP]
.sp 1
.IP "\fIframeBorderWidth\fP\ (class\ \fIFrameBorderWidth\fP)"
This resource specifies
the width (in pixels) of a client window frame border without resize
handles.  The border width includes the 3-D shadows.  
The default value is based on the size and resolution of the screen.
.IP "\fIiconBoxGeometry\fP\ (class\ \fIIconBoxGeometry\fP)"
This resource indicates the
initial position and size of the icon box.  The value of the resource is a
standard window geometry string with the following syntax:
.sp 1
[\fI=\fP][\fBwidth\fP\fIx\fP\fBheight\fP][{\fI+-\fP}\fBxoffset\fP{\fI+-\fP}\fByoffset\fP]
.sp 1
If the offsets are not provided, the iconPlacement policy is used to
determine the initial placement.  The units for width and
height are columns and rows.
.sp 1
The actual screen size of the icon box window depends on the
iconImageMaximum (size) and iconDecoration resources.  The
default value for size is (6 * iconWidth + padding) wide by (1 * iconHeight
+ padding) high.  The default value of the location is +0 -0.
.IP "\fIiconBoxName\fP\ (class\ \fIIconBoxName\fP)"
This resource specifies the name
that is used to look up icon box resources.  The default name is
"iconbox".
.IP "\fIiconBoxSBDisplayPolicy\fP\ (class\ \fIIconBoxSBDisplayPolicy\fP)"
This resource specifies the scroll bar display policy of
the window manager in the icon box.
The resource
has three possible values:  all, vertical, and horizontal.
The default value, "all", causes both vertical
and horizontal scroll bars always to appear.
The value "vertical" causes a single vertical scroll bar to appear
in the icon box and sets the orientation of the icon box to
horizontal (regardless of the iconBoxGeometry specification).
The value "horizontal" causes
.ne 3
a single horizontal scroll bar to appear
in the icon box and sets the orientation of the icon box to
vertical (regardless of the iconBoxGeometry specification).
.IP "\fIiconBoxTitle\fP\ (class\ \fIIconBoxTitle\fP)"
This resource specifies the name
that is used in the title area of the icon box frame.  The default value is
"Icons".
.IP "\fIiconDecoration\fP\ (class\ \fIIconDecoration\fP)"
This resource specifies the general icon decoration.
The resource value is label (only the label part is displayed)
or image (only the image part is displayed) or label image
(both the label and image parts are displayed).
A value of activelabel can also be specified to get a label
(not truncated to the width of the icon)
when the icon is selected.
The default icon decoration for icon box icons is that each icon has a
label part and an image part (label image).
The default icon decoration for stand alone icons is that each icon has an
active label part, a label part, and
an image part (activelabel label image).
.IP "\fIiconImageMaximum\fP\ (class\ \fIIconImageMaximum\fP)"
This resource specifies the maximum size of the icon \fBimage\fP.

A horizontal (vertical) layout value should not be used for both the
\fBprimary_layout\fP and the \fBsecondary_layout\fP
(for example, don't use top for the \fBprimary_layout\fP and bottom for the
\fBsecondary_layout\fP).
The \fBprimary_layout\fP indicates whether, when an icon placement is done,
the icon is placed in a row or a column and the direction of placement.
The \fBsecondary_layout\fP indicates where to place new rows or columns.
For example, top right indicates that icons should be placed top to bottom
on the screen and that columns should be added from right to left on the
screen.
The default placement is left bottom
(icons are placed left to right on the screen, with the first row on the
bottom of the screen, and new rows added from the bottom of the screen
to the top of the screen).
A \fBtight\fP value places icons with zero spacing in between icons.  This
value is useful for aesthetic reasons, as well as X-terminals with small
screens.
.IP "\fIiconPlacementMargin\fP\ (class\ \fIIconPlacementMargin\fP)"
This resource sets the distance between the edge of the screen and the
icons that are placed along the edge of the screen.
The value should be greater than or equal to 0.
A default value (see below) is used if the value specified is invalid.
The default value for this resource is equal to the space between
icons as they are placed on the screen (this space is based on maximizing
the number of icons in each row and column).
.IP "\fIkeyBindings\fP\ (class\ \fIKeyBindings\fP)"
This resource identifies the set of key bindings
for window management functions.
If specified,
these key bindings \fBreplace\fP the built-in
default bindings.
The named set of key bindings is specified in
\fIdtwm\fP resource description file.
The default value for this resource is "DefaultKeyBindings".
.IP "\fIlimitResize\fP\ (class\ \fILimitResize\fP)"
If this resource is True, the user is not allowed to resize a window
to greater than the maximum size.
The default value for this resource is True.
.IP "\fImaximumMaximumSize\fP\ (class\ \fIMaximumMaximumSize\fP)"
This resource is used to limit the maximum size of a client window
as set by the user or client.
The resource value is \fBwidth\fP\fIx\fP\fBheight\fP (for example, 1024x1024)
where the width and height are in pixels.
The default value of this resource is twice the screen width and height.
.IP "\fImoveOpaque\fP\ (class\ \fIMoveOpaque\fP)"
This resource controls whether the actual window is moved or a
rectangular outline of the window is moved.  A default value of False
displays a rectangular outline on moves.
.IP "\fIresizeBorderWidth\fP\ (class\ \fIResizeBorderWidth\fP)"
This resource specifies the width (in pixels) of a client window frame
border with resize handles.  The specified border width includes the 3-D
shadows.
The default value is based on the size and resolution of the screen.
.IP "\fIresizeCursors\fP\ (class\ \fIResizeCursors\fP)"
This is used to indicate whether the resize cursors are always displayed
when the pointer is in the window size border.
If True, the cursors are shown, otherwise the window manager cursor is
shown.
The default value is True.
.IP "\fItransientDecoration\fP\ (class\ \fITransientDecoration\fP)"
This controls the amount of decoration that \fIdtwm\fP puts on transient
windows.
The decoration specification is exactly the same as for the
\fIclientDecoration\fP (client specific) resource.
Transient windows are identified by the WM_TRANSIENT_FOR property, which
is added by the client to indicate a relatively temporary window.
The default value for this resource is menu title (that is, transient
windows have frame borders and a titlebar with a window menu button).
.sp 1
An application can also specify which decorations \fIdtwm\fP should apply
to its windows.
If it does so, \fIdtwm\fP applies only those decorations indicated by
both the application and the \fItransientDecoration\fP resource.
Otherwise, \fIdtwm\fP applies the decorations indicated by the
\fItransientDecoration\fP resource.
For more information see the description of \fIXmNmwmDecorations\fP on
the \fIVendorShell(3)\fP reference page.
.IP "\fItransientFunctions\fP\ (class\ \fITransientFunctions\fP)"
This resource is used to indicate which window management functions are
applicable (or not applicable) to transient windows.
The function specification is exactly the same as for the
\fIclientFunctions\fP (client specific) resource.
The default value for this resource is -minimize -maximize.

.IP "\fIuseIconBox\fP\ (class\ \fIUseIconBox\fP)"
If this resource is given a value of
True, icons are placed in an icon box.  When an icon box is not used,
the icons are placed on the root window (default value).
.IP "\fIworkspaceCount\fP\ (class\ \fIWorkspaceCount\fP)"
This is the initial number of workpaces that \fIdtwm\fP creates
when starting up. In the Common Desktop Environment, this
resource should only appear in an applications defaults files. 
This resource is saved as part of a user's session when \fIdtwm\fP 
shuts down. The user may add or delete workspaces dynamically from 
the front panel during the session and this resource records the
number of workspaces for the session.

.IP "\fIclientDecoration\fP\ (class\ \fIClientDecoration\fP)"
This resource controls the amount of window frame decoration.
The resource is specified as a list of decorations to specify their
inclusion in the frame.
If a decoration is preceded by a minus sign, that decoration is excluded
from the frame.
The \fBsign\fP of the first item in the list determines the initial
amount of decoration.
If the sign of the first decoration is minus, \fIdtwm\fP assumes all
decorations are present and starts subtracting from that set.
If the sign of the first decoration is plus (or not specified), then
\fIdtwm\fP starts with no decoration and builds up a list from the
resource.
.sp 1
An application can also specify which decorations \fIdtwm\fP should apply
to its windows.
If it does so, \fIdtwm\fP applies only those decorations indicated by
both the application and the \fIclientDecoration\fP resource.
Otherwise, \fIdtwm\fP applies the decorations indicated by the

the \fIdtwm\fP resource description file.
.PP 
\fIdtwm\fP uses the environment variables XFILESEARCHPATH,
XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, XAPPLRESDIR, XENVIRONMENT, LANG, and HOME in
determining search paths for resource defaults files.
\fIdtwm\fP may also use XBMLANGPATH to search for bitmap files.
.PP
\fIdtwm\fP uses DTAPPSEARCHPATH to search for application configuration
information. DTDATABASESEARCHPATH is used to search for action database
definitions and front panel (*.fp) files. Help files are located with
the use of DTHELPSEARCHPATH. Icon images are found via DTICONSEARCHPATH
and DTICONBMSEARCHPATH.
.PP 
\fIdtwm\fP reads the $HOME/.motifbind file if it
