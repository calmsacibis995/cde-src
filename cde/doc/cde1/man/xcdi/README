These are source files for the X/Open draft.  These files are not part
of the CDE sample implementation.  They are here for your reference,
but there is insufficient data in the tree to actually build the
document from these files.  The X/Open build environment is rather
complex and nonportable; people attempting to use the tools [available
from X/Open] are on their own, although I would happy to commiserate
with you.
