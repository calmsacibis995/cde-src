.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDtWsmGetCurrentBackdropWindows\fP is designed to work with the 
Common Desktop Environment window/workspace manager (dtwm).
.PP
\fBDtWsmGetCurrentBackdropWindows\fP returns a list of the windows 
that are used in the backdrop for the current workspace.
.sp .5
.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 1.00i
The X display.
.IP "\fIroot\fP" 1.00i
The root window of the screen of interest.
.IP "\fIppWins\fP" 1.00i
Address of a pointer to receive the returned pointer to the list of
window identifiers. This data should be freed with \fBXtFree(3X)\fP. 
If there is no backdrop window for a workspace, then a NULL pointer is
returned.
.IP "\fIpNumWins\fP" 1.00i
Address of a integer to receive the number of elements in the window
list. If there is no backdrop window for the workspace, then the number
returned here is zero.
.PP

.SH RETURN VALUE
.IP "\fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i
The number of windows returned is in \fI*pNumWins\fP. If there is no
backdrop, then this number is zero and no data was allocated and needs
to be freed. If the number is greater than zero, then data was allocated
and a pointer returned in \fI*ppWins\fP.
.IP "not \fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i
The function failed and no data was allocated or returned. This may be
due to a memory allocation error or failure to find the correct
workspace information (i.e. dtwm was not running).
