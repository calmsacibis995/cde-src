.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDtWsmGetWorkspaceInfo\fP is designed to work with the
Common Desktop Environment window/workspace manager (dtwm).
.PP
\fBDtWsmGetWorkspaceInfo\fP returns detailed information on a specific
workspace. 
.sp .5
.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 1.00i
The X display.
.IP "\fIroot\fP" 1.00i
The root window of the screen of interest.
.IP "\fIaWs\fP" 1.00i
The workspace name (converted to an X atom).
.IP "\fIppWsInfo\fP" 1.00i
Address of a variable to receive the returned pointer to the workspace
information data. This data should be freed by calling
\fBDtWsmFreeWorkspaceInfo\fP when it is no longer needed.
.PP
The workspace information is returned in a structure of this form:

.sp .5
.IP "\fIworkspace\fP" 1.20i
The workspace name (converted to an X atom).
.IP "\fIbg\fP" 1.20i
The pixel id used for the background color of the backdrop.
.IP "\fIfg\fP" 1.20i
The pixel id used for the foreground color of the backdrop.
.IP "\fIbackdropName\fP" 1.20i
The backdrop file name (converted to an X atom).
.IP "\fIcolorSetId\fP" 1.20i
The number of the colorset used for this workspace. This affects the
backdrop color as well as the color of the button for htis workspace on
the front panel.
.IP "\fIpchTitle\fP" 1.20i

running.
.IP "\fIbackdropWindows\fP" 1.20i
A pointer to an array of windows that make up the backdrop. This may be
useful for applications that are interested in some events on the
root window. Since the backdrop covers the root window, button events are
caught by the backdrop before they reach the root.
