.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDtWsmAddWorkspaceFunctions\fP enables workspace functions for a
window. When workspace functions are enabled, the window menu for the
window displayed by the Common Desktop Environment workspace manager 
(dtwm) will show entries that allow the window to occupy a different
set of workspaces, occupy all workspaces, or be removed from this 
workspace. Workspace functions are
enabled by default, so this function is typically called to restore
workspace functions to a window that has had them removed by 
\fBDtWsmRemoveWorkspaceFunctions\fP.
.PP
\fBDtWsmRemoveWorkspaceFunctions\fP removes workspace functions from a
window. When workspace functions have been removed, the window menu for
the window displayed by dtwm will not have the entries that allow
the window to occupy a different set of workspaces, occupy all
workspaces, or be removed from the current workspace.
.PP
Both these functions take these two parameters:
.sp .5
.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 1.00i
The X display.
.IP "\fIwindow\fP" 1.00i
The window that will have its workspace functions affected.
.PP
These functions should be called before the window is mapped. 
Dtwm only looks at the workspace function information at the time the 
window is managed. If the window is currently managed by dtwm, the 
window should be withdrawn, the workspace functions changed, and the 
window mapped once again.

.SH RETURN VALUE
