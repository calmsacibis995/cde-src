Tt_status tt_message_arg_xval(Tt_message \f2m\fP,

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn tt_message_arg_xval
function
retrieves and deserializes the data from a message argument.
This function uses an XDR routine that is supplied by the client.
.P
The
.I m
argument is the opaque handle for the message involved in this operation.
The
.I n
argument is the number of the argument to be returned.
The first argument is numbered zero.
The
.I xdr_proc
argument
points to the XDR procedure to be used to deserialize the data in the
.IR n th
argument into newly allocated storage,
the address of which will be stored in the pointer whose address is
.IR value .
.P
The
.I value
argument is the data to be deserialized.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
Upon successful completion, the
.Fn tt_message_arg_xval
function returns the status of the operation as one of the following
.B Tt_status
values:
.VL 8
.Lc TT_OK
The operation completed successfully.
.Lc TT_ERR_MODE
.br
The specified
.B Tt_mode
is invalid.
.Lc TT_ERR_NOMP
.br
The
.Cm ttsession 1
process is not running and the ToolTalk service cannot restart it.
.Lc TT_ERR_POINTER
.br
The pointer passed does not point to an object of
the correct type for this operation.
.Lc TT_ERR_NUM
.br
The integer value passed was invalid (out of range).
.Lc TT_ERR_XDR
.br
The XDR procedure failed on the given data, or evaluated to a
zero-length structure.
.LE
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
The allocation calls are made by the XDR procedure; therefore, any
storage allocated is not allocated from the ToolTalk allocation stack.
The application should
use the
.Fn xdr_free 3
call to free this storage.
