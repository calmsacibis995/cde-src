.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are designed to work with the Common Desktop Environment
window/workspace manager (dtwm).
.PP
\fBDtWsmGetWorkspacesOccupied\fP returns the list of workspaces in which
this window resides. Each element of the list is the name of a workspace
(converted to an X Atom).
.sp .5
.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 1.00i
The X display.
.IP "\fIwindow\fP" 1.00i
The window of interest.
.IP "\fIppaWs\fP" 1.00i
The address of pointer to receive the pointer to a list of workspace
names (converted to X Atoms). These data should be freed with
\fBXtFree(3x)\fP.
.IP "\fIpNumWs\fP" 1.00i
The address of an integer to receive the number of elements in the
list of workspaces returned in \fI*ppaWs\fP.
.PP
\fBDtWsmSetWorkspacesOccupied\fP puts a window into a set of
workspaces.
.sp .5
.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 1.00i
The X display.
.IP "\fIwindow\fP" 1.00i
The window to be put into this set of workspaces.
.IP "\fIpaWs\fP" 1.00i
The pointer to a list of workspace names (converted to X Atoms). These
are the workspaces into which the window should be placed.
.IP "\fIpNumWs\fP" 1.00i
The number of elements in the list of workspaces \fIpaWs\fP.
.PP
NOTE: \fBDtWsmSetWorkspacesOccupied\fP does not validate the list of 
requested workspaces. Invalid workspaces in the list are ignored.
.sp .5
.SH RETURN VALUE
Only \fBDtWsmGetWorkspacesOccupied\fP has a return value.
.PP
.IP "\fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i
The function performed without error. A list of workspace identifiers
was allocated and returned. 
.IP "not \fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i
The function failed either due to a memory allocation error or failure
to find the correct workspace data (i.e. dtwm was not running).
