.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBDtWsmGetWorkspaceList\fP returns a list of the names of the currently
defined workspaces. Each name has been converted into an X atom.
\fBDtWsmGetWorkspaceList\fP is designed to work with the Common Desktop
Environment window/workspace manager \fBdtwm\fP.

.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 1.00i
The X display.
.IP "\fIroot\fP" 1.00i
The root window of the screen of interest.
.IP "\fIppaWorkspaces\fP" 1.00i
Address of a pointer to receive the returned pointer to the workspace
list. Each atom in the returned list can be converted to a string name
via \fBXGetAtomName(3X)\fP. This data should be freed with 
\fBXtFree(3X)\fP. 
.IP "\fIpNumWorkspaces\fP" 1.00i
Address of a integer to receive the number of elements in the workspace
list.
.PP
To get detailed information on all the available workspaces, first call
\fBDtWsmGetWorkspaceList\fP to get the names of all the workspaces. Then,
for each workspace in the list, call \fBDtWsmGetWorkspaceInfo(3X)\fP to 
get detailed information for that workspace.

.IP "\fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i
The workspace list was allocated and returned successfully. 
.IP "not \fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i

be due to a memory allocation error or failure to find the correct
workspace information (i.e. dtwm was not running).
