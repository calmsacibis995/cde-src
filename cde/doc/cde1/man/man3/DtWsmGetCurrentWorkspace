window/workspace manager (dtwm).

.sp .5
.IP "\fIdisplay\fP" 1.00i
The X display.
.IP "\fIroot\fP" 1.00i
The root window of the screen of interest.
.IP "\fIpaWorkspace\fP" 1.00i
The address of an Atom to receive the identifier for the current
workspace.
.PP
\fBDtWsmSetCurrentWorkspace\fP sets the current workspace. This function
can be used to switch to from the current workspace to another
workspace. It takes the following arguments:
.sp .5
.IP "\fIwidget\fP" 1.00i
A realized widget on the screen of interest. Note that a window is
required from this widget.
.IP "\fIaWorkspace\fP" 1.00i
The name (in X Atom form) of the workspace that should be made current.
.PP
NOTE: \fBDtWsmSetCurrentWorkspace\fP simply sends a message to dtwm to switch 
workspaces. If the workspace identifier is not valid, no error is
reported.
.sp .5
.SH RETURN VALUE
.IP "\fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i
The function performed without error.
.IP "not \fBSuccess\fP" 1.00i
