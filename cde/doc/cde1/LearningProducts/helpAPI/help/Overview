The overriding objective, or "prime directive," 
for providing online help is:

<p indent>!!Get the user back on task as quickly 
	  and successfully as possible.!!

When a user (your audience) requests help, there's an immediate need for
information or assistance.  Online help tightly integrated
with the user's current context is more likely to satisfy the user's
need with context-sensitive information.

The HP Help System has been created with the prime directive in mind.

<s1 id=ToicsVolumesFamilies>Topics, Volumes, and Families

Online help is presented to the user as individual ++help topics++.
That is, each help window displays a single topic.

Help topics are arranged -- usually in a hierarchy -- to form 
a ++help volume++.  Typically, each application has its own help volume.

A Help Volume Contains Help Topics

Help volumes are collected into sets called ++help families++.  Families
are intended to provide a level of organization for creating logical
groups of related applications or stand-alone help volumes.

<figure entity=temporary>
A Help Family is a Set of Related Help Volumes
<\figure>

For example, the HP Visual User Environment (HP VUE) consists of several
applications -- File Manager, Workspace Manager, Style Manager, and so on.
Each of these applications has its own help volume.  All of the volumes
are collected into a single "HP VUE" help family.

The organization provided by help families is only exposed by applications
whose function it is to list available help.  The HP VUE Help Manager is
such an application.
