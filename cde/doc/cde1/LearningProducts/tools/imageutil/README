imageutil is a utility program for using the Image Library (IL).  It can be 
used for demonstrations or to create or display TIFF files.  It also serves as
a programming example for using the IL.

The following files are included:

README
    This file.

imageutil.doc
    Description of how to use imageutil.

Makefile
    Make file for HP-UX.  Type "make" in the directory containing the below 
    files to make the program "imageutil".

imageutil.c
    Mainline of imageutil and all command line parsing and overall control
    code.  This file has very few calls to the IL, and is not a good example
    of how to use the IL.

ilu.c
    Image Library Utility (ILU) package, which can be used independent of 
    imageutil.c as a package to simplify the use of the IL.  This file has
    most all of the calls to the IL, and is intended as a programming example
    for using the IL.  Note that the IL use is located at the beginning of the
    file.

ilucheck.c
    Contains iluChecksumPipe() which adds a filter to a pipe to calculate
    a checksum.  This function is used for the "-checksum" option.

ilu.h
    Include file for ilu.c and ilucheck.c
