Marc:

In order to do nightly builds of online help in the build tree, we will need
makefiles. 


One Makefile resides in the graphics directory for each help volume.
The graphics directory contains the tiff,pm,and bm files used in the product.
A subdirectory named Source contains source files in various formats.

The makefile does the following with the source files:
	
	* .xwd files: creates a tiff version of the file in the graphics
            directory.
	* .pm and .bm files: merely copies the file to graphics

The xwd to tiff utility exists in a tools directory in the learning products
portion of the build tree.



Another makefile or script will have to process the source text files
(modules).  Ron Voll has written that takes raw text files and creates
online and hardcopy versions.  Although we will not be building the
hardcopy manual in the tree, I would like to build it's modules there, since
they use the same source files and conversion script.





Another makefile will have to build each help volume.  This must be done
last.
