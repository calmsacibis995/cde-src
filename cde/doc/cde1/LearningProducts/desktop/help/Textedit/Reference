<s1 id=UnixKeyBindings>Unix Key Bindings

<idx | Unix keybindings|
<idx | keybindings: Unix|
<idx | Emacs keybindings|


Unix key bindings provide a set of extended Emacs keys,
such as Control+F (forward character) and Control+N (next line),
in Text Editor. To enable Unix key bindings (which are
set off by default), do the following:


<list order>
* Edit the <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer> file in your home directory by
adding this line to the file: 

<ex>
#include "/usr/dt/app-defaults/<var>lang<\var>/UNIXbindings"
<\ex>


Replace <var>lang<\var> with the value of your language environment
variable. If the <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer> file does not exist,
create the file in your home directory.

* Log out of your current session.

* Log in and restart Text Editor.

<\list>
<p>&sigspace;

When you use Unix key bindings, Text Editor provides alternate menu
accelerators for these commands:


<lablist nowrap><labheads>

\Command \ Alternate Menu Accelerator

\Undo (Control+Z)\             Control+_
\Paste (Control+V)\            Shift+Insert
\Find/Change (Control+F)&sigspace;\      Control+S
\Print (Control+P)\            <emph>no alternate<\emph>
<\lablist>


<p>&sigspace;
If you want to modify these menu accelerators, copy
the contents of the
<computer>/usr/dt/app-defaults/<var>lang<\var>/UNIXbindings<\computer>
file into your <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer> file, and then make your
changes.

<note>
When Unix key bindings are enabled, the Delete key deletes the previous
character rather than the character that follows the cursor.

<s1 id=copytofileDialog>Text Editor Copy To File Dialog Box

Other applications can use Text Editor as a tool to edit information
and may restrict how editing changes are saved. For example, in some
instances the Save As command may be replaced by Copy To File,
which enables you to create a copy of the information
you are viewing or editing without changing your edit session to the
new file.


<figure nonumber entity=TextEditorCopyToFile>
<\figure>
                 
<lablist nowrap>
\Enter path or folder name&sigspace;\      Identifies the path name of the
current folder. You can choose your home folder or mounted CD-ROMs and diskettes through the menu button at the end of the text field.  

\Filter\     An asterisk (*) shows all files. You can enter
                     wildcard characters to display only those files that
                     match an extension. For example, *.doc lists
only those files with a .doc extension.

\Files\          Lists files located in the current folder.
                    
\Folders\    Lists folders located in the current folder.

\ Enter file name \   Field in which you type a new file name for your document.
\OK\             Copies the information to the file name provided.

\Update\ Displays a new list of files after
changing the filter key or changing to a new folder.

\Cancel\         Cancels the Save As operation.

If you use Wrap To Fit, these additional choices appear in the
dialog box:


<figure nonumber entity=TextEditorWordWrap>
<\figure>


<list bullet>
   
* Add newline characters to the end of word-wrapped lines.

This is the default choice. It adds a newline character to the
end of each wrapped line and preserves line breaks 
exactly as they appear in your document.

* Do not add newlines. Only line breaks created by Return
will be preserved.


This option retains the "soft" line breaks inserted by Wrap To Fit.
If you reopen the document, the text conforms to the width of the
new window.

<s1 id=TextEditorCommandSyntax>Text Editor Command-line Syntax and Options

<idx | Text Editor: starting in Terminal window|

The command-line syntax for starting Text Editor is:

<ex>
dtpad [%%options%%] 
<\ex>

Where %%options%% is one or more of the following:


<lablist nowrap>

 \ <computer>-server<\computer> \ Specifies that Text Editor should be started in server
mode with no initial window displayed. Subsequent invocations of Text
Editor that run in the default requestor mode cause the server to create
a separate edit window for each request. 


 \ <computer>-standAlone<\computer> \ This option forces Text Editor to run in standalone
mode in which it handles its own editing independently of the Text Editor
server. This can be useful if one desires an instance of
Text Editor with an environment different from that of other Text Editor
windows.  An example would be running an instance under a different locale,
or with different color resources. This is equivalent to setting
the <computer>standAlone<\computer> resource to True.


\ <computer>-exitOnLastClose<\computer>\ Specifies that the Text Editor server process
should terminate when the last edit window for the display is closed. This
option is applicable only with the <computer>-server<\computer> option. If this option is not
specified, the Text Editor server process remains active indefinately, even
when all edit windows have been closed.


 \ <computer>-noBlocking<\computer>\  Specifies that the Text Editor
requestor terminate as soon as the Text Editor server signifies that it can
access a file in the referenced folder. In the absence of this option the
Text Editor requestor process will block, and will exit only when it
receives notification from the Text Editor server that the window has been closed.


 \ <computer>-statusLine<\computer>\  This option causes Text Editor to display a status
line at the bottom of the edit window. The status line reports the line
number where the cursor is located, the total number of lines in the document,
application messages, and alerts the user when Overstrike mode is on.
It also provides a way to move the cursor to a specific line number.

 \ <computer>-wrapToFit<\computer>\  Specifies that Wrap To Fit is set on at start up.

<s1 id=TextEditorResources>Text Editor Resources

<idx | application resources|
<idx | resources|

The following resources control the appearance and behavior of
Text Editor.


<computer>Dtpad*server: [ true | false ]<\computer>

<p indent>Specifies that Text Editor should be started in server mode to 
process all subsequent edit requests for the display. Setting this resource
to True is equivalent to specifying the <computer>-server<\computer> command-line option.

<computer>Dtpad*standAlone:  [ true | false ]<\computer>

<p indent>Specifies whether the current Text Editor process should run in
standalone mode, where it handles its own editing, or in requestor mode,
where the actual editing is handled by a single, separate Text Editor
server process. Setting this resource to True is
equivalent to specifying the <computer>-standAlone<\computer> command-line option.


<computer>Dtpad*blocking:  [ true | false ]<\computer>

<p indent>Specifies that when Text Editor is run in the default
requestor mode, where the actual editing is handled by a separate Text
Editor server process, the requestor process should not exit until the
window associated with the edit request is closed. Setting
this resource to False is equivalent to specifying the 
<computer>-noBlocking<\computer> command-line option.

<computer>Dtpad*exitOnLastClose:  [ true | false ]<\computer>

<p indent>Specifies whether the Text Editor server process should terminate when
the last active edit window is closed.  If this resource is set to False, then the
Text Editor server will continue to run, ready to receive a message to edit
a file. If this resource is set to True, the Text Editor server will terminate when the last active
edit window is closed.


<computer>Dtpad*statusLine:  [ true | false ]<\computer>

<p indent>Specifies whether Text Editor should display the status line at
the bottom of the edit window. Setting this resource to True is equivalent
to specifying the <computer>-statusLine<\computer> command-line option.

<computer>Dtpad*wrapToFit:  [ true | false ]<\computer>

<p indent>Specifies whether Text Editor should have Wrap To Fit enabled
(True) or
disabled (False) when the editor is started.  Setting this resource to True
is equivalent to specifying the <computer>-wrapToFit<\computer> command-line
option.
