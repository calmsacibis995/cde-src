\ Category: \ Click Information for information about the selected file or
folder. Click Permissions to view or edit file or folder permissions.

\ File Name: \ The Properties dialog box displays information pertinent 
to the file
or folder whose name appears in the File Name field. If you launch the 
Properties dialog box from 
the command line, you can enter a file or folder name into the File Name 
text field. 

\ Link Name: \ Contains the name of the linked file, if the selected file is a
link. This field is read-only.

select a file or folder name that appears in the 
File Name field. The Browse button only appears when you open Properties 
from the Application Manager or the command line.

\ OK \ Applies the current settings and closes the dialog box.


\ Apply \ Applies the current settings and keeps the dialog box open.

\ Reset \ Resets the Properties dialog box to reflect the current state 
of the file or folder.

<s1 id=FMPPermissionsDialogDE>Permissions Dialog Box

        <idx>Permissions dialog box<\idx>


Use the Permissions dialog box to view or edit file or folder permissions.

<newline>&empty;
<figure nonumber entity=Permissions>
<\figure>
<newline>&empty;

<procedure> Basic Permissions

Use the Basic Permissions section to change the read, write, and execute
permissions of files or folders you own.  


<lablist nowrap>

\ Owner: \ The user that owns the object.  

\ Group: \ Users that have been grouped together by the system administrator. 
For example, the members of a department might belong to the same group. This 
group is the owning group and usually includes the file or folder's owner.

\ Other: \ All other users on the system besides the owner and owning group. 

\ Apply Changes To: \ Indicates the scope of permissions changes (both basic and
Access Control List). If File Name contains the 
name of a file, this contains three options: This File Only, All Files 
in Parent Folder, All Files in Parent Folder and its Subfolders. If 
File Name contains the name of a folder, this contains two options: 
This Folder Only, This Folder and all its Subfolders. The default behavior
is to apply changes to the file or folder whose name is in the File Name
field.


\ Show Access Control List \ Displays the Access Control List Permissions
section of the Permissions dialog box. This button toggles between Show Access
Control List and Hide Access List, which hides the Access Control List 
Permissions section of the Permissions dialog box. A file or folder must reside on a Solaris 2.5 or later server or system, and you must be running Solaris 2.5 software or later, to set, modify, and view ACLs on that file or folder. If 
these conditions are not met,
the Show Access Control List button will be unavailable.

\ Effective column: \ Shows the actual permissions in effect, which may be 
different from the check box settings because of the mask.

<\lablist>
 

<procedure>Access Control List Permissions

Use the Access Control List Permissions section to define or modify 
ACLs of files or folders you own.


<lablist>

\ Type \ Type of user(s) to whom you give ACL permissions. 


\ Name \ Name of the user or group listed in the Type field. The Default Group, Default Owning User, Default Owning
Group, Default Other, and Default Mask types have no name associated with them. 

\ Requested \ The read, write, and execute permissions
requested for the specified Type and Name.

\ Effective \ The actual read, write, and execute permissions that the file 
or folder has, for the specified Type and Name, after restricting the Requested 
permissions with the Mask values. 


\ Add \ Displays the Add Access List Entry dialog box. 


\ Delete \ Deletes the selected Access Control List entry. 

\ Change \ Displays the Change Access List Entry dialog box.
