Error message dialog boxes appear on the CDE desktop
whenever you try to change permissions or set or change ACLs on a file or
folder and:

<list bullet>
* You do not have permission to do so
<\list>  

<emph>OR<\emph>

<list bullet>
* A system error occurs
<\list>

The dialog box always contains the file or folder name at the top of the
display area. It then contains the error message and an explanation of or 
reasonable guess at why the error occurred.

If you are performing an operation on a single file or folder, the error dialog 
box looks something like this:
 
<newline>&empty;
<figure nonumber entity= ErrorSngl>
<\figure>
<newline>&empty;


If you are performing an operation on multiple files or folders, the error 
dialog box looks something like this:

<newline>&empty;
<figure nonumber entity= ErrorMult>
<\figure>
<newline>&empty;

In the latter case, the button functionality is:

<lablist nowrap>

\ Continue: \ Does not change permissions for the current file and 
continues the operation in progress.

\ Cancel: \ Does not change permissions for the current file and 
cancels the operation in progress.

\ Help \ Displays help about the error dialog box.
