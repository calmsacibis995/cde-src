<s1 id=popup>&calcname; Options Menu
<idx|options menu|
The &calcname; options menu appears when you click Options in the
&calcname; menubar.  It also appears when you click button 3 in the &calcname;
window and on most buttons.  Some buttons (Functions, Constants, Accuracy,
Store, Recall, and Exchange) have unique popup menus or dialogs that appear
when you click button 3. The on-item help for each of these buttons
describes the menu for that button.

Here's how the &calcname; popup menu appears when
&calcname; is in Scientific or Logical mode:
