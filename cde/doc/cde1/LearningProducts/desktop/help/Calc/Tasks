<s1 id=enternum>To Enter Numbers
You can enter numbers into the calculator in two ways:
<list bullet tight>
*Typing the numbers from the keyboard
*Clicking mouse button 1 on the number buttons
<\list>
For example, to enter the number 47.5, move the pointer into the
&calcname; window and do one of the following:
<list bullet tight>

<s1 id=DdbTask>To Calculate Depreciation Using Double-Declining Balance
Use Ddb to calculate the depreciation allowance on an asset for a specified

Certain values must be in
specific memory registers when you use the depreciation functions.  For
Ddb, the values and the corresponding
memory registers are:
<list bullet tight>
*Memory Register 0 - Amount paid for the asset 
*Memory Register 1 - Salvage value at the end of useful life
*Memory Register 2 - Useful life of the asset
