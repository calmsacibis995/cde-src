After you submit a document (print job) for printing, you can use the Print 
Manager or Printer Jobs applications to find out about the progress of the 
printing.  Printer Jobs gives you information about jobs on a single 
printer.  Print Manager shows all the printers that are on your system.                   

Print Manager provides an easy way to print files, find print jobs, cancel
print jobs, and look at printer and print job status.
