Use Mailer to send, receive, and manage your electronic mail messages.  
When you receive an electronic or email message, you can act on it in various ways:
<list bullet tight>
<item> Save a message to a Mailbox in your file system
<item> Reply to the sender of the message
<item> Forward the message to another recipient along with your own message
<item> Delete the message
<item> Print the message
<\list>
You can send and receive attachments: image files, document files, or executable files.

You can also drag and drop files from other desktop applications, such as File Manager, 
for use as attachments in your mail messages.


<procedure>To Open Mailer

<p>Click the Mailer control in the Front Panel.

<p>When you start Mailer for the first time on your system, it looks for
whether you have a local Inbox or remote Internet Messaging Access Protocol
(IMAP) Inbox in your email setup.
 
<note>Your system administrator must set up a server that uses IMAP4
(Internet Messaging Access Protocol, Version 4) before you can access and
work with email in remote mailboxes.<\note>
 
<list bullet>
<item>If the setup does not indicate the type of mailbox you have, Mailer
prompts you to specify the mailbox type.
 
<item>If the setup indicates that your mailbox is local, Mailer opens your
Inbox that usually resides in the directory <computer>/var/mail/<\computer><var>user_name<\var>.
 
<item>If the setup indicates that your mailbox is remote, Mailer opens the
<xref DTMAILHELPLOGIN> so you can log in to the IMAP server.
<\list>

After Mailer starts, the mailbox is displayed, along with message headers 
and a view of the selected message.
