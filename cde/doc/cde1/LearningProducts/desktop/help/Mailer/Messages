<term nogloss>and cannot run because the execution group is incorrectly set.<\term>
<!--
<location id=DTMAILHELPNOINSTALLMAIL>&empty;<\location>
-->

<p>On some systems, Mailer must be run with the group id (execution group)
set to <computer>mail<\computer>.  Your execution group has not been set 
so that Mailer can run.     

<procedure>Possible solution:

<list bullet>
<item> Check with your system administrator to set the group permission

<s1 id=DTMAILHELPOPENREADONLY>Mailer cannot obtain exclusive access to this mailbox.
<term nogloss>You can choose to open this mailbox read-only or open it read-write<\term> 
<term nogloss>without exclusive access.<\term>
<newline>&empty;<newline>
<term nogloss>Caution: Click Read-Write only if you are sure that neither <\term>
<term nogloss>you nor anyone else has this mailbox open in another mail <\term>
<term nogloss>application.  If this mailbox is open in another mail <\term> 
<term nogloss>application, clicking Read-Write can corrupt or destroy your mailbox contents.<\term>

<p>Mailer cannot obtain exclusive access to this mailbox because another
mail application currently has this mailbox open for read-write.  If
two mail applications open the same mailbox for read-write at the same
time, changes could be lost or your mailbox could become corrupted.

<procedure>Possible solutions:

<list bullet>
<item>Open the mailbox read-only.
<item>Open the mailbox for read-write.  Do so only when no one
else is using this mailbox.
<item>Cancel the request to open this mailbox.
<\list>


<s1 id=DTMAILHELPOPENREADWRITEOVERRIDE>Mailer is unable to obtain exclusive access
<term nogloss>to this mailbox because the system is not responding.<\term>

<newline>&empty;<newline>
<term nogloss>For this time only, you can choose to open this mailbox <\term>
<term nogloss>read-only, or to open it read-write without exclusive <\term>
<term nogloss>access.<\term>
<newline>&empty;<newline> 
<term nogloss>Caution: Click Read-Write only if you are sure that neither <\term>
<term nogloss>you nor anyone else has this mailbox open in another mail <\term>
<term nogloss>application.  If this mailbox is open in another mail <\term> 
<term nogloss>application, clicking Read-Write can corrupt or destroy your mailbox contents.<\term>

<!--
<location id=DTMAILHELPOPENREADWRITEOVERRIDE>&empty;<\location>
-->

<p>ToolTalk is not available or not responding on the system where the
mailbox is located. If this is a temporary condition or a mailbox you
seldom open, follow the solutions for this time only; otherwise, follow
the solutions for the long term. If you are unable to determine if this is a 
temporary condition, contact your system administrator.

<procedure>Possible solutions for this time only:

<list bullet>
<item>Open the mailbox read-only.
<item>Open the mailbox read-write without exclusive access. It is up to
you to make sure that this mailbox is not opened read-write in another
mailer by you or another user.
<item>Cancel this operation.
<\list>

<procedure>Possible solutions for the long term:

<list bullet>
<item> Disable ToolTalk locking in Mailer permanently. To do this, 
choose Advanced from the Options menu, and then deselect 
the option: Use network aware mail file locking. If you 
choose to disable ToolTalk locking in Mailer permanently, Mailer will not 
prevent you and other users from bringing up two instances of Mailer on 
the same mailbox concurrently. However, if two instances of Mailer 
open the same mailbox for read-write at the same time, changes could 
be lost, or your mailbox could become corrupted.
<\list>


<s1 id=DTMAILHELPTAKELOCK>Someone else is using this mailbox.
<term nogloss>Would you like to demand exclusive access?<\term>
<!--
<location id=DTMAILHELPTAKELOCK>&empty;<\location>
-->

<p>Mailer cannot obtain exclusive access to this mailbox because another
mailer currently has this mailbox open for read-write. If two instances of 
Mailer open the same mailbox for read-write at the same time, changes could
be lost, or your mailbox could become corrupted.

<procedure>Possible solutions:

<list bullet>
<item> If you would still like to access the mailbox read-write, click OK.
Mailer will then request the lock on this mailbox to be released, and 
cause the other Mailer that has this mailbox open to close the
mailbox after saving any changes that have been made. If the request is 
successful, you will have read-write access to the mailbox.
<item> Choose Cancel to end the attempt to open this mailbox for read-write.
<\list>

<term nogloss>in which you can read messages.  You cannot change this <\term>
<term nogloss>mailbox or check for new mail from it.<\term>

<\list>

<procedure>Possible solutions:
