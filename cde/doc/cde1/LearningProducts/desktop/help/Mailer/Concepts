<s1 id=OverviewOfMailSI>An Overview of Mailer
Text TBD
You have one default mailbox where all of your messages 
are received, but you can create other mailboxes to store 
groups of messages together. Xref To Create a Mailbox and 
To File a Message to Other Mailboxes for more information??? 
Xref to Basic Skills for using windows, etc.

<s1 id=MailContainerElementsSI>Parts of a Mailbox
When you open your mailbox for the first time you see that 
it is made up of several parts. These are the Menu Bar, the 
Message Header List, the Control Area, the Message View, and 
the Attachment List, if any are displayed. 
<lablist>
\ Menu Bar \ Accesses the available menus and items within 
Mailer.   

\ Message Header List \	Contains all of the messages in your 
mailbox and you can scroll through the list if it is longer 
than what is currently displayed. You can also use the sash to 
resize the list to display more or fewer messages than what is 
displayed. This is where new messages are displayed in your inbox.
See, <xref MessageHeaderListOptions> for more information.

 
\ Control Area \	Contains buttons that allow you to  perform 
certain frequently used functions without accessing  the 
menus or  using keyboard accelerators. These buttons are 
Delete, Next, Previous, Reply to Sender, and Print. 

\ Message View \	Where the actual text of the message is 
displayed. You'll notice that when a message is selected in 
the Message Header List, the text of that message is displayed 
here. If you select another message from the list, then the 
text of the newly selected message is displayed and so forth. 
If the mail message you are viewing contains an attachment  you 
see an icon representing the attachment with the name the 
sender gave the attachment. If more than one attachment 
is included, they are in the order they were sent.  

See <xref MAttachmenu> for information on the 
Attachment Menu, or To View an Attachment for information on how 
to open and view an attachment.
<\lablist>

<s1 id=MMsgElementsSI>Parts of a Mail Message
The three main parts to any mail message you send or receive 
are the Header Fields, the Text of the message, and Attachments 
to the Message, if any.
<lablist>
\ Header Fields \	When you are looking at a mail message in 
your mailbox, the Message View contains the Header Fields 
and the text of the message. Typically the header fields 
contain the From: (the email address of the sender of the message), 
Date: (the Date and Time the message was received), To: (this is 
where you see your email address), and the subject of the message. 
The Sender, Subject, Date and Time all appear in Message 
Header List and are selected for the message you are viewing. 
You may see more information in the header depending on the 
mail system the sender is using and if you have Full Headers 
displayed. 

See the <xref MViewMenu> for more information. 

\ Text of the Message \	Just below the header fields is the 
text of the actual message you are viewing.  If the message 
is longer than what is currently displayed, you can scroll through 
the message or use the sash to resize the message view.

\ Attachments (optional) \	There are many types of mail 
attachments: text, graphics, programs, and so forth. 
Depending on the actions you have available, you can 
view or start the attachment. If many attachments are included, 
you can scroll through them as well.

<s1 id=MAddressesSI>Email Addresses
An email Address is like your personal zip code for 
receiving mail messages. This is also the way you send 
messages to other email users. The format used for 
email addresses is: username@location. Your system 
administrator uses this format to set up personal 
email addresses. 

<s1 id=MAliasesSI>About Aliases
An alias is just a  private name for a group of user 
names. By creating a distribution list of 
usernames (you frequently send to) and giving 
it an alias, you can just  type the name of the 
alias instead of typing each username in the To: 
field every time you send a message. The name you 
give to your alias can be descriptive of a group of 
users or just a name you will remember. This alias only
works for your username from your machine.

<s1 id=MCustomSI>Customizing Mailer
Once you have been an email for some time, you might 
want to change some of the Mailer defaults. The Mail 
Options menu item from the Mailbox menu allows you to 
change options for Mailer Format Settings, Message 
Header List, Message View, Compose Window, Message 
Filing, Vacation Mail, Templates, Aliases, and 
Advanced User items.

<s1 id=MOrganizeSI>Organizing Your Mail
After using Mailer you may need to file certain mail 
messages away for safekeeping.  Since it is not practical 
to keep all of your mail messages in your Inbox, you 
may want to set up mailboxes for storing your messages. 
You can create mailboxes by project, users, email lists 
or any other system that works for you. 

See <xref CreatingMailboxsTA> for information on how 
mailboxes can be created.
