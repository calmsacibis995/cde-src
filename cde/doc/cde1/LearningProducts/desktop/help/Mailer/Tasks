<item>Type the text you want to look for in the appropriate field.
<p>You can search for a match on the To, From, Subject, and Cc fields.  
If you type your criteria in multiple fields, Mailer searches for 
messages that match <emph>all<\emph> the criteria.
<p>Within each field, Mailer considers the input as one criterion even if
there are multiple strings separated by spaces or commas.  For
example, if you type <computer>wood smith<\computer> in the To field, Mailer 
looks for a message that is addressed to <computer>wood smith<\computer>, 
not <computer>wood<\computer> or <computer>smith<\computer>.
<p>The fields are <emph>not<\emph> case-sensitive.
<item>Click Search Down or Search Up to find the next or previous
matching message in your mailbox.   To find all the matches, click Select All.

Once you have created a mailbox other than your Inbox, you 
can file messages in it. You may want to establish mailboxes 
for different projects or different email lists you receive.

<!--
You can either configure Mailer to automatically file some 
of your incoming messages as they arrive in these mailboxes, 
or manually file the messages.

<procedure>To set up automatic message filing:

<list order tight>
<item>Choose Filing and Notification from the Options menu.

<item>Under Message Filing, click the New Rule button.

<p>The Rules Editor dialog box appears.

<item>Type a name under Rule name.

<item>Type your criteria in one or more of the fields: To, CC, To or Cc, 
From, and Subject.  

<p>For the subject field, Mailer matches against the entire sequence of 
characters you type in that field.  All other fields accept multiple 
entries, separated by commas or spaces.  Only one entry needs to match 
before automatic message filing takes place.

<p>For example, <computer>mary.smith tom.wood<\computer> in the To field 
means a message that is addressed to either <computer>mary.smith<\computer> 
or <computer>tom.wood<\computer>.

<p>In the case of entries in multiple fields, an incoming message must match 
the criteria in <emph>all<\emph> of these fields before Mailer will file 
it away.  If you want messages that match the criteria to be filed in more 
than one mailbox, create separate rules for each mailbox. 

<item>Type the full path name of the mailbox to which you would like to 
file the messages in the <quote>Store message to<\quote> text field.

<p>Alternatively, click Select Mailbox to specify the path name from 
a File Selection dialog box.

<item><emph>Optional<\emph>.  Once an incoming message matches this rule, 
if you wish Mailer to stop matching it against the rules that follow 
in the Rules scrolling list in the Filing and Notification Options dialog 
box, select the option <quote>Skip remaining rules if message matches this rule.<\quote> Otherwise, deselect the option.

<p>If this option is off, however, as long as an incoming message matches 
the rules in the scrolling list, Mailer may file it in multiple mailboxes.
With this option on, Mailer files a message only in the first mailbox that 
matches the rule.

<item>Click Add.

<p>The rule is now displayed in the Rules scrolling list in the Filing 
and Notification Options dialog box.

<item>To change the status to Off, select the Off button.

<p>The status is On by default.

<item>Click OK or Apply.
<\list>

<note>To avoid conflicts, if you use programs other than Mailer for 
automatic message filing, turn them off before enabling this feature 
in Mailer.<\note>
-->

<procedure>To manually file messages in other mailboxes:
 
<p>Select the messages that you want to file, then do one of the following:
 
<list bullet>
<item>Choose Select Mailbox from the Move menu (or the Copy To submenu
of the Message menu) and select the desired mailbox in the File Selection
dialog box.
 
<item>Choose Other Mailboxes from the Move menu (or the Copy To
submenu of the Message menu) and indicate the mailbox.
 
<item>Drag and drop messages to other mailboxes.
<p>See <xref DragAndMessageTA> for more information.
<\list>

<p>For convenience, you can:
 
<list bullet>
<item>Add mailoxes where you frequently file messages to your Move menu
(and the Copy To submenu of the Message menu) mailboxes. 
<p>For details, refer to the <xref AddingMBtoMenusTA>.
 
<item>Set your Move menu to display the most recently visited mailboxes.

<item>Choose Continue Composing Draft from the Compose menu, then 
choose the draft you would like to work on from the submenu.
<p>The Compose window opens with the draft loaded.

<note>If the Compose window is already open, you can load the draft by 
choosing its name from the Use Draft submenu in the Compose Format menu.

<item>Continue with your edits and send the message as usual.
<p>After you have clicked Send, Mailer posts a message that asks if you

	<idx>formats, messages, MIME or Sun Mail Tool<\idx>

You can send messages in two different formats:
<list bullet>
<item>Internet MIME
<item>Sun Mail Tool
<\list>

<p>The default is Internet MIME.  To change this default, see the option,
<link hyperlink=dtmailSendMailInMIME>Send mail in MIME format<\link>, in the
<xref AdvancedMailOptions>.

<p>Mailer sends messages in MIME format. If your email recipients 
see confusing codes like <computer>=20<\computer>
or <computer>=09<\computer> in the messages that you send, their mail 
applications are not MIME-compliant. 

<p>You can solve this problem by having your email recipients use
a MIME-compliant mail application.  If that is not possible, you
can do the following:

<list order tight>
<item>Choose Advanced from the Options menu.
<item>In the Advanced Options dialog box, deselect the option, <quote>Use strict MIME character encoding.<\quote>
<item>Click OK.
<\list>
  
<p>This solution makes the <computer>=20<\computer>
or <computer>=09<\computer> strings appear less frequently.

<p>If neither of these solutions work, then send your email in Sun Mail
Tool format.  However, most MIME-compliant mail readers do not understand 
this proprietary format.

<procedure>To Send Mail Messages in MIME or Sun Mail Tool Format:
<list order tight>
<item>Choose Send As from the Compose window File menu.
<item>From the submenu, choose either Internet MIME or Sun Mail Tool.
<p>Your message is sent in the selected format.
