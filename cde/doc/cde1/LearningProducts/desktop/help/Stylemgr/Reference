\ Default \ Set all controls to the default mouse settings.
 
\ Handedness: \  Specifies the mapping of the mouse buttons.  The Right
        setting arranges the buttons from left to right, the typical
        mapping for use by right-handed people.  The Left setting arranges them
        from right to left.  The mouse picture in the upper left corner
        shows the button arrangement for the current selection.
 
\ Button 2: \  Specifies whether the middle mouse button performs the
        Transfer or Adjust operation for lists and text.  Transfer refers
        to the drag-and-drop action and Adjust is also known as extend.
 
        With the Transfer setting, you use mouse button 2 to drag and
        drop list or text items, if such action is supported in the
        application.
 
        With the Adjust setting, you extend list selections in
        a multiple-select list or extend the text selection in text
        fields with mouse button 2 and you drag and drop list and text
        items with mouse button 1.

<note>
On a two-button mouse, button 2 is used to pop up the menu; therefore,
the previous information does not apply.
<\note>
 
\ Double-click \  Specifies the double-click speed, or the speed at
        which you must click a mouse button twice for the system to sense
        a double-click.  Test the new speed by double-clicking the mouse
        picture in the upper left corner of the dialog box.
 
\ Acceleration \  Specifies how fast the pointer moves across the screen
        when in acceleration mode.  A setting of 2, for example, causes
        the pointer to move twice as fast as the mouse moves.
 
\ Threshold \  Specfies the minimum number of pixels you must move
        the mouse at one time before the pointer moves at the accelerated
        speed.  With threshold and acceleration adjustments, the mouse
        can be used for precise alignment when it is moved slowly, or
        moved quickly across the screen at the accelerated speed.

        changed, the new value goes into effect immediately, even before
        you click OK.
 
        <note>
        In a system without screen lock extensions, the default system screen
        saver is used, !!not!! the screen savers shown in this dialog
        box.  In this case, the screen savers in this dialog box
        are used only for screen lock.
        <\note>
        
\ Screen Saver Preview \  Displays a demonstration of the last screen
        saver selected.


\ Screen Saver List \  Displays the available screen saver behaviors in
        a multiple-select list.  Select or deselect a behavior by
        clicking on the list item.
 

\ Time per Saver \  Specifies the number of minutes each selected screen
        saver runs before the next one starts.


\ Screen Lock: \ Enables (On) or disables (Off) Screen Lock on a timeout.
        When this setting is changed, the new setting goes into effect
        immediately, even before the dialog box is closed.
 
        If screen saver and screen lock are both enabled (On) and the Start
        Lock value is smaller than the Start Saver value, when the screen
        lock times out it replaces the contents of the screen with the
        currently selected screen savers.  If Start Lock is
        greater than Start Screen, then the automatic screen lock
        simply continues the current screen saver.
 
        If the screen saver is disabled (Off) and automatic screen lock
        is enabled (On), when the screen lock times out the screen contents
        of the screen are not covered with a screen saver.
  
  \ Start Lock \  Specifies the number of minutes from the last pointer move
        or keystroke before the screen lock starts.  When this value is
        changed, the new value goes into effect immediately, even before
        you click OK.
