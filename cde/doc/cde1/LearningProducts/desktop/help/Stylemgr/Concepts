Your display type and the Number of Colors selection determine the number of
colors buttons that make up a palette. To keep the number of colors
used on a high-color display to a minimum, Number of Colors is set to 
More Colors for Applications
by default.  To increase the number of color buttons on a
high-color display, select More Colors for Desktop
in the Number of Colors To Use dialog box and
restart the current session.
 
While you can't use more colors than your display allows, you
can reduce the amount of colors used by the Desktop by specifying a
lower-value color usage.
 
For example, if you have a high-color display and have selected
More Colors for Desktop
in the Number of Colors To Use dialog box, but you want to run a color-rich
application such as a CAD program, you should choose
More Colors for Applications or Most Colors for Applications
to decrease the number of colors the desktop uses.  The remaining
colors are available for the CAD program.
