<s1 id=Printing>Printing Help Topics
					<idx|printing help topics|
					<idx|help, printing|
<note>
Printing online help is disabled in the CDE Desktop
software snapshot (October 1993).  If you select the Print
option in a Help window, a message states that printing is
currently unavailable. 
<\note>

<procedure>To print help topics:

<list order>

 * Choose Print from the File menu to display the Print dialog (Alt+F, P).

 * Select the topics you want to print:

   <list bullet tight>
    * Print All -- to print all topics.
    * Print Current Topic -- to print only the current topic (the default).
    * Print Current and Down -- to print the current topic and its subtopics.
   <\list>

 * Choose OK.

<\list>


<!-- PRINTING IS DISABLED IN OCT RELEASE

<note>

   In quick help dialogs, the Print button immediately prints the current
   topic, without displaying the Print dialog.

By default, printed output from HP Help is directed to your default
printer.  You can specify another printer by setting the ``printer.name''
resource.  If you are not printing to a LaserJet Series III (or later)
printer, you must also set the ``printer.%%name%%.model'' resource.

<s3 id=Printing-ChoosingAPrinter-Personal>To choose a printer for yourself

<list order>

 * Copy the ``/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Helpprint'' file into your home
   directory and make it writable.

 * Edit your ``/%%HomeDirectory%%/Helpprint'' file, setting the ``name''
   and ``model'' resources for the printer you want to use:

<ex>
*printer.name:  %%name%%
*printer.%%name%%.model:  %%model%%
<\ex>

Where %%name%% is the device name of the printer and %%model%% is
either ``LJII'' or ``LJIII''.  The default model is ``LJIII''.
<\list>

Your system administrator may have already edited the ``Helpprint'' file to
configure the correct models for the printers on your system.  If so, you
specify just the ``printer.name'' to access the correct printer.

Comments within the ``Helpprint'' app-defaults file also describe how to
set the page size, if your paper is not the default size.

<procedure>Examples

Suppose you have a LaserJet II printer named ``hp-laser''.  To direct all
printed help topics to that printer, enter these resources into your
``Helpprint'' file:

<ex>
*printer.name:             hp-laser
*printer.hp-laser.model:   LJII
<\ex>

!!Or!!, suppose you want to direct all printed help topics to a LaserJet
III printer named ``lj3d''.  Since the default model is ``LJIII'', you need
to specify only this single resource:

<ex>
*printer.name:        lj3d
<\ex>

<s3 id=Printing-ChoosingAPrinter-System>To choose a printer for all users

<list order>

 * Login as superuser.

 * Edit the ``/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Helpprint'' file, adding the
   necessary ``model'' resource for each printer as follows:

<ex>
*printer.%%name%%.model: %%model%%
<\ex>

Where %%name%% is the device name of the printer and %%model%% is
either ``LJII'' or ``LJIII''.  The default model is ``LJIII''.

 * To specify the default printer, use the printer ``name'' resource:

<ex>
*printer.name:  %%name%%
<\ex>

Where %%name%% is the device name of the printer you are configuring.

<s2 id=Printing-Command>Printing Help from the Command Line
					<idx|printing help topics|
					<idx|help, printing|

Printing within the HP Help System is actually done by a separate
program called ``helpprint''.

<note>
  Running the ``helpprint'' program directly is intended for advanced
  users or online help developers.  
<\note>

You can run ``helpprint'' to print
a help topic using a command like this:

<ex>helpprint -helpVolume %%volume%% -locationId %%id%%<\ex>

Where %%volume%% is the name of the help volume you want to print and
%%id%% is the internal ID string associated with the topic you want
to print.  

An additional option, ``-R'', causes all subtopics to be printed.
For example, to print all of the topics in a help volume named "Vuefile," 
the command is:
<ex smaller>helpprint -R -helpVolume /usr/vhelp/volumes/C/Vuefile.hv -locationId _hometopic<\ex>

The ``helpprint'' program is installed in the directory ``/usr/vue/bin''
by default.  You may need to add that directory to your path before
running ``helpprint''.
