<!-- Here's where to put configuration tasks that relate to online help.
     For example, if your application requires particular configuration for
     its online help, describe those tasks here.

     The topic title should be "Configuring Help" and the ID should
     be ConfiguringHelp.  (Consistency helps others link to this volume
     with confidence that the topics will be found.)

     Configuration tasks are purposely not exposed in the home topic to
     prevent novice users from being intimidated. -->
