A <link definition-definition Definition>dashed underline<\link> also
indicates a hyperlink.  The only difference is that the related topic is
displayed in a smaller !!quick help!! dialog.

<procedure>Graphics as Hyperlinks

Graphic images within help topics may be hyperlinks.  Unlike text, however,
the graphic is not underlined if it is a hyperlink.  Generally, the text
associated with a graphic tells if the image is a link.

<procedure>Hyperlinks that Performs Actions

Some hyperlinks perform actions (rather than jumping to another topic).
For instance, the following link starts a program: <link "xclock &"
Execute>Display X Clock<\link>.

For help windows displayed from within an application, it is also possible
for a hyperlink to invoke some application-specific behavior.

  help display area, the press mouse button 3.	(On a two-button mouse,

  help dialogs, use the Backtrack command button.
