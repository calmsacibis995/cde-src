<s2 id=Execution-Policy>Execution Link Confirmation Dialog Box

<idx |Help, Execution Link Confirmation dialog box|
<idx |hyperlinks, execution link policy|
<idx |execution link, policy|

An execution hyperlink executes a command instead of displaying
a help topic. Because execution links interact with your
system, you can choose how you want the Help System to respond
when an execution link is selected.

The Help System default behavior is to display a confirmation
dialog box.


<figure nonumber entity=Help4HelpExecutionDlg>
<\figure>

Execution policy is controlled by the Help dialog widget resource
<computer>DtNexecutionPolicy<\computer>.  The default value is 
<computer>help_execute_query_unaliased<\computer>.

To change the default behavior, you add the 
execution policy resource to your <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer>
file for the application you want to change.

The set of resource values is:

<lablist nowrap>
\<computer>help_execute_all<\computer>\Executes all execution links without
displaying a confirmation dialog box.

\<computer>help_execute_query_unaliased<\computer>\ Displays a dialog box
only for those links which do not have execution aliases defined. An
execution alias is a resource that assigns a name to the command executed
by an execution link.

\<computer>help_execute_query_all<\computer>\Displays a dialog box for all
execution links

\<computer>help_execute_none<\computer>\Disables all execution links, but
displays the execution command in a dialog box

<\lablist>


<procedure>Example
To disable all execution links within your application, perform
these steps:

<list order>
* Create an <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer> file in your home directory or
edit the current <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer> file to include this
resource:

<ex>
<var>application_name<\var>*executionPolicy:help_execute_none
<\ex>

* Replace <emph>application_name<\emph> with the name of the application
you want to change. If you are unsure of the name of the application,
consult your application documentation.

* Start the application.

* To test your change, choose the application Help menu and display a topic
that contains an execution link.
<\list>

<note>Before modifying the execution policy for an application's help
volume, carefully review all execution link commands and their interaction
with your system.  <\note>

<p>&sigspace;
For more information about the Help System execution policy
refer to the <emph>Help System Author's and Programmer's Guide<\emph>.

You can change the default window size for general help or quick help
windows by modifying resources. The &dquote;rows&dquote; resource
determines window height and the &dquote;columns&dquote; resource sets
the window width. The display font affects window dimensions.


<list order>

* Create an <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer> file in your home directory or
edit your current <computer>.Xdefaults<\computer> file.

* Choose which resources you want to add from the examples which follow.


* Replace <var>application_name<\var> with the name of the application you
want to change and supply new rows and columns values. If you do not know
the name of the application, consult your application documentation.

 
* Start the application.

* To check the new window size, choose the application's Help menu. If
  you have modified one of the quick help window types, be sure to 
  choose a topic that is displayed in the type of window you have changed.
