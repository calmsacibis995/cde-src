Topics within a help volume are arranged in a hierarchy.  The topic at the
top of the volume's hierarchy is called the <term nogloss|home topic|.
To browse to other topics, you use hyperlinks.

Most hyperlinks take you deeper into the topic hierarchy by displaying
subtopics.  Some hyperlinks, however, may jump across the hierarchy -- even
into another help volume -- to display related topics.

<procedure>Knowing Where You Are

In general help windows, the Topic Hierarchy provides a table of contents
that lists all of the topics and subtopics in the current help volume.

<figure nonumber entity=H4H-TopicHierarchy> <\figure>

The home topic is at the top of the list.  An arrow ( -> ) points to the
current topic and shows your location in the help volume. You can use the
table of contents to jump to any topic -- each item is a hyperlink.

the Topic Hierarchy, move the sash, between the topic map and the topic
display area.
