Like the index in a book, the Keyword Index lists important words and
phrases.  Topics related to each index entry are listed in the Keyword
Topic List. 

<figure nonumber entity=H4H-KeywordIndex> <\figure>


<procedure>To find an index entry:

<list order>

 * Choose Keywords from the Search menu (Ctrl+K) to display the Keyword
   Index dialog.

 * !!Optional:!!  Type all or part of the keyword you are looking for in
   the Keyword Filter field.  As you type, the keyword list is shortened to
   show only the keywords that begin with the characters you type in (case
   is ignored).

 * In the Keyword List, select the keyword you are looking for.

 * In the Keyword Topic List, select a title of the topic you want to view.

<\list>

You may use the Keyword Index to view as many topics as you want.
When you are done, chose Close.

<note>
 The scope of the keyword index is limited to the current help volume.
