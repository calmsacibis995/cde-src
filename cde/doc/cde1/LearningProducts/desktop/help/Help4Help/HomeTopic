<hometopic>Using Help
<abbrev>Using Help

Help organizes information into topics. You choose
and display help topics in a help window.

<procedure>
You can choose a topic in two ways:

<list bullet>
* Select a title in the list of topics at the top of the
  help window.

* <emph>Or,<\emph> choose a hyperlink in the display area of the help window.

A <emph>hyperlink<\emph> is an active word, phrase, or graphic that
&dquote;jumps&dquote; to a related topic. In a help window, any 
underlined text is a hyperlink. A grey open-cornered box identifies
a graphic hyperlink.


Hyperlinks look like this in a help topic:
<\list>

<figure nonumber entity=Help4HelpHomeGraphic>
<\figure>

<p>&sigspace;

To learn more about using Help, click <link
hyperlink="Table-Of-Contents">this hyperlink<\link>
for a list of topics.
