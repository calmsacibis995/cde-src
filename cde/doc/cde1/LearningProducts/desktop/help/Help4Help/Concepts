<procedure>Execution Hyperlinks
Most hyperlinks display help topics, but a hyperlink can also execute a
command. When you choose an execution hyperlink, the Help System displays
a confirmation dialog box that enables you to choose whether to execute
the command. To change the default behavior, see <xref Execution-Policy>.

<p>&sigspace;

To select topics or hyperlinks using the keyboard, 
see <xref Mouse-And-Keyboard>.

* <term nogloss | Help Volume|

A help volume is a collection of topics that describe an application or
a particular subject.  Typically there is one help volume per application.

Similar to an outline, a volume is a hierarchy of
topics.  For example, an application might organize its help using these
categories: Introduction, Tasks and Reference. Each of these in turn
contains more detailed topics. 


<figure nonumber entity=Help4HelpOrganization>

* <term nogloss | Home Topic|

The top-level topic in a volume is called the home topic. It is
the first topic in a help volume.


* <term nogloss | Help Family|

A help volume can be assigned to a help family. A family includes one
or more help volumes. This allows several related volumes to be grouped under a
single name.

To browse the list of help families available on your desktop, see <xref ToBrowseDesktopHelp>.
