<s1 id=WhatCreateActionDoes>Files Created by Create Action
	<idx|Create Action:files created by|
	<idx|action name|


 The output from Create Action is:

<list bullet>
* An action definition that runs a command. A file  
  ``%%HomeFolder%%/.dt/types/%%action_name%%.dt'' is created containing the 
 definition.

	<idx|action icon|
* An <term>action icon<\term> for the action. The action icon is placed in your home 
 directory. The icon runs the action command when it is double-clicked. 
 Optionally, you can make the action icon a drop zone by specifying 
 droppable data types.

* If you use the advanced functions of Create Action, it may also create:

<list bullet tight>
* One or more data types for the application's data files.
* Open and Print actions for the data type
<\list>

The data type(s) and Open and Print actions are also written to the file 
``%%HomeFolder%%/.dt/types/%%action_name%%.dt''.

<s1 CreateActionFunctionality>Limitations of Create Action


<procedure>Create Action Limitations
	<idx|Create Action:action limitations|

You cannot use Create Action to create the action for an application if: 

<list bullet>

* The command line requires a non-file parameter. For example, you cannot 
use Create Action to write an action for the command: 

<ex>lp -d%%device%% %%filename%%<\ex>

where the user has to supply device each time the command is executed. 
(You can manually create an action that does this.) 

* You want the user to see a different label on the action icon than the action 
  name. For example, you cannot use Create Action to provide a local-
  language version of an existing action.

* The action requires some of the advanced features of the action database,
such as actions that:
<list bullet tight>
	* Launch commands on systems remote from the action definition.
	* Invoke other actions.
	* Must be run as a different user (for example, as superuser).
	* Make extensive use of the "map" feature. 
	*Have very different behaviors, depending on the number of file 
          arguments supplied to the action.  
	<\list>

<\list>

<procedure>Data Type Limitations
	<idx|Create Action:data type limitations|


 You cannot use Create Action to create the data type for an application if:

<list bullet>
* The data type must have additional actions associated with it other than 
  Open and Print.
* The Open action for the data type is not the action's command. For example, 
  you cannot use Create Action to create the data type that provides a unique 
  icon for the directory representing the application's application group.
