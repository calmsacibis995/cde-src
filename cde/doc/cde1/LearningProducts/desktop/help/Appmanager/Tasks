The icon that starts the application is called
the !!application icon!! or !!action icon!!.

In some cases, you may also be able to start the application by
dropping a data file on the action icon.

	<idx|applications:reloading|





Application Manager is created the first time you log in, and
is rebuilt each time you log in.  Each time it is built, it searches
certain system and network locations for applications and places them in
Application Manager.

If your system administrator adds an application, you can update
your Application Manager:

<list bullet>

* Log out and back in.

* !!Or!!, open the Desktop_Tools application group and
  double-click Reload Applications.

<s1 id=CreatePersonalAppGroup>To Create a Personal Application Group
	<idx|application group:personal|
	<idx|Application Manager:modifying|


A personal application group is a group that you alone own.
You create the group yourself and have permission to modify it.


<list order>

* Create a directory:
<ex>
``%%HomeDirectory%%/.dt/appmanager/%%app_group_name%%''
<\ex>

where !!app_group_name!! is the name of the application group as it
will appear in Application Manager.

* Open the Desktop_Tools application group and double-click
  Reload Applications.

 You should now see your new application group at the top level of
 Application Manager.

<\list>

You can treat your personal application group like any other directory
to which you have write permission. You can move or copy files to it, create
subdirectories, and delete unwanted files.

<s1 id=AddAppToPersonalGroup>To Add an Application to a Personal Application Group
	<idx|Application Manager:modifying|
	<idx|applications:adding|



The following procedure:

<list bullet>
* Creates an action for your application. 

 An action is a desktop
 construct that behaves like a macro--it automates tasks usually
  done with command lines. The desktop uses actions to connect command
  lines with icons.

* Creates an action icon representing the application in the application group.

<\list>

<list order>

* If necessary, create an application group to which you have
write permission. See <xref CreatePersonalAppGroup>.

* Determine the command line you would use to start the application from
  a terminal emulator window. 

	<idx|Create Action|
* Use the desktop application Create Action to create the action.
  See <link hyperlink="CreatAct ToCreateAction" Jump>
  To Create an Action With Create Action<\link>.

  Create Action requires you to enter an action name. The name you supply
  becomes the label on the action. 

  Create Action creates an action icon in your home folder. The icon
  consists of an executable file with the same name as the action.

* Copy or move the action icon created by Create Action from your
  home folder to the personal application group.

<s1 id=AddApplications>To Register Applications in Application Manager
	<idx|applications:registering|
	<idx|registering applications|
	<idx|Application Manager:modifying|





When an application is registered in Application Manager, it has its own
application group. This application group is available to all users
on the system.

Registering applications is a system administration task. For 
instructions, see the
<book>
Common Desktop Environment Advanced User's and System Administrator's
Guide
