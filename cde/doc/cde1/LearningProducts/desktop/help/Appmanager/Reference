	<idx|Application Manager:file names|

	<idx|action labels|
	<idx|labels for action icons|





In File Manager and Application Manager, files and folders are represented as icons,
and these icons are usually labeled with the file name.

Action icons are sometimes an exception to this rule.  For example,
display the pop-up menu for the action icon in the Desktop_Tools
application group labeled Digital Clock. Notice that the file name,
which is shown at the top of the pop-up menu, is not the same
as the label.

<figure nonumber entity=AppManagerFileName>

The actual file name appears in the Copy File and Link File dialog boxes.


<s1 id=AppManagerPaths>Folder Location of Application Manager
	<idx|Application Manager:folder location|



Application Manager behaves very much like File Manager. This
is because Application Manager is a File Manager view of a special
folder on your system used to gather registered applications.
Login Manager creates the Application Manager folder
each time you log in. 

Ordinarily, you do not need to know the location the Application
Manager folder. However,
it may be useful to you if you are trying
to troubleshoot problems.


Its location is:

<ex>
/var/dt/appconfig/appmanager/%%special_folder_name%%
<\ex>

where !!special_folder_name!! is a name assigned by the system
that is unique for your system and login name.

<note>
You should !!never!! attempt to directly modify the
!!special_folder_name!! folder.
<\note>


	<idx|dtappgather|
	<idx|Reload Applications action|


After Login Manager creates the folder, it runs a desktop program
named ``dtappgather'' that gathers all the application groups.

During a session, you can rerun ``dtappgather'' by double-clicking
Reload Applications in the Desktop_Tools application group.

At the top of each pop-up menu are two standard commands:
Put In Workspace and Put in Trash. 

The actions for the object's

contain other types of application files such as
README files, OpenWindows applications, and templates. (OpenWindows
can be seen as an application group in Application Manager. You can
