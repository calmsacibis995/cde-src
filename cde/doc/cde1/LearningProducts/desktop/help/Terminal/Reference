<s2 id=Synopsis>SYNOPSIS
``dtterm''
[-options]

<s2 id=Description>DESCRIPTION
The %%dtterm%% client provides runtime support of legacy applications
written for ANSI X3.64-1979 and ISO 6429:1992(E) conformant character
terminals such as the DEC VT220.

<s2 id=Options>OPTIONS
The %%dtterm%% terminal emulator
accepts all of the standard X Toolkit command line options along with
additional options all of which are listed below (if the option begins
with a `+' instead of a `-', the option is restored to its default value):

<!-- spec pages 11 through 17 -->

<p id=minus132>
``-132''
<p indent>Normally the DECCOLM escape sequence that switches between
80 and 
132 column mode is ignored. This option causes the DECCOLM escape
sequence to be recognized, and the ``dtterm'' window will resize
appropriately.
<idx|c132|
<p indent>Associated resource: <link c132> ``c132''<\link>.

<p id=plus132>
``+132''
<p indent>This option causes the DECCOLM 
escape sequence to be ignored.  This is the
default behavior.
<idx|c132|
<p indent>Associated resource: <link c132> ``c132''<\link>.

<p id=minusaw>
``-aw''
<p indent>This option indicates that auto-wraparound 
should be allowed. This
allows the cursor to automatically wrap to the beginning of the next
line when it is at the right-most position of a line and text is output.
This is the default behavior.
<p indent>Associated resource: <link autowrap> ``autoWrap''<\link>.
<idx|autoWrap|

<p id=plusaw>
``+aw''
<p indent>
This option indicates that auto-wraparound should not be allowed.
<p indent>Associated resource: <link autowrap> ``autoWrap''<\link>.
<idx|autoWrap|

<p id=bkgndopt>
``-background'' !!background_color!!
<p indent>
This option specifies the background of the terminal window as well as the
default background used for the scroll bar and the X11 pointer cursor.
Under CDE, this option defaults to the primary
colorset select pixel or background pixel(see

<p indent>
This option specifies an executable program to be invoked as a subprocess
when ``dtterm'' is started.
This option must be the last option on
the command line.
<p indent>
%%program_argument ...%%  specifies the program and command line arguments
to execute.

``-fb'' !!fontset!!
<p indent>
This option specifies an XFontSet to be used when displaying bold terminal
text.  It should be specified as a Motif XmFontList.
Only character or mono spaced fonts are supported.  The behavior when
using proportional fonts is undefined.
A default bold font will be generated based on the XLFD
name of the userFont.
If that font is not available, bold text
will be generated by overstriking (with a one pixel offset) the
userFont.
<p indent>
!!fontset!!   specifies the bold terminal XFontSet to use.
<p indent>
Associated resource: <link userFont> ``userFont''<\link>.

<p id=fgopt>
``-fg'' !!foreground_color!!
<p indent>

well as the default foreground color used for the scroll bar and the
for the X11 pointer cursor.  Under CDE, this resource
will default to the primary color set foreground pixel.  Without CDE,
this resource will default to ``*foreground'' or ``*Foreground'' with
an ultimate fallback color of white.
<p indent>
!!foreground_color!!    specifies the foreground color to use.
<p indent>
<idx|foreground|
Associated resource: <link fg> ``foreground''<\link>.

<p id=fn>
``-fn'' !!fontset!!
<p indent>

placed on the display as a normal window. This is the default behavior.
<p indent>
Associated resource: <link iconic> ``iconic''<\link>.

``-j''
<p indent>
This option specifies that jump scrolling should be used. Under jump
scrolling, the screen may be scrolled more than one line at a time. This
provides for faster screen updates when multiple lines of text are being
sent to the terminal. The maximum number of lines that may be jump
scrolled is limited to the number of lines in the terminal window. It is
guaranteed that
all lines will be displayed. This is the default behavior.
<p indent>
<idx|jumpScroll|
Associated resource: <link jumpScroll> ``jumpScroll''<\link>.

description of jump scrolling, see ``-j'' above.
<p indent>
Associated resource: <link jumpScroll> ``jumpScroll''<\link>.

``-kshMode''
<p indent>
This option specifies that ksh mode should be enabled.
Under ksh mode, a key pressed with the extend modifier bit set will
generate an escape character followed by the character generated by the
un-extended keystroke. This option is provided for use with emacs and
the emacs command line editor mode of ``ksh(1)'' or ``ied(1)''. It
conflicts with the normal use of the meta key for generating extended
single byte characters, and for generating multi-byte Asian characters.
<idx|kshMode|
<p indent>
Associated resource: <link kshMode> ``kshMode''<\link>.

``+kshMode''
<p indent>

the default behavior.
<p indent>
Associated resource: <link kshMode> ``kshMode''<\link>.

``-l''
<p indent>
This option enables output logging. When logging is enabled, all output
received from the subprocess is logged either to a file or to a command
pipeline (as specified via the ``-lf'' option below). Since the data is
being logged directly from the subprocess, it includes all escape
characters and carriage return/newline pairs sent by the terminal line
discipline.  Output may be enabled and disabled via
escape sequences.
<p indent>
<idx|logging|
Associated resource: <link logging> ``logging''<\link>.

``+l''
<p indent>
This option disables output logging. For a description of output

above is written.  If %%file_name%% begins with a pipe symbol (``|''), the rest of
the string is assumed to be a command to be used as the endpoint of a pipe.
The default filename is ``DttermLog''%%XXXXX%% (where %%XXXXX%%
is the process id of ``dtterm'') and is created in the directory from which
``dtterm'' was started.  If the last five characters are "XXXXX," they
are replaced by the process ID. 
<p indent>
!!file_name!!  specifies the log file name to use.
<p indent>
<idx|logFile|
Associated resource: <link logfile> ``logFile''<\link>.

``-ls''
<p indent>
This option indicates that the shell that is started 
should be a login shell (i.e. the first character of ``argv[0]'' will be a dash,
indicating to the shell that it should read the system's ``profile''
and the  user's ``$HOME/.profile'' (for ``ksh'' and ``sh'') or the system's
``csh.login'' and the user's
``$HOME.login'' (for ``csh'').
<p indent>
<idx|loginShell|
Associated resource: <link logShell>``loginShell''<\link>.

``+ls''

Associated resource: <link maponout> ``mapOnOutput''<\link>.

``-mb''
<p indent>
This option indicates that ``dtterm'' should ring a margin bell when the user 
types near the right margin.  The actual distance involved is specified by
the <link nb> ``-nb''<\link> option.
<p indent>
<idx|marginBell|
Associated resource: <link marginBell> ``marginBell''<\link>.

``+mb''
<p indent>
This option indicates that margin bell should not be rung when the user
types near the right margin.  This is the default.

``-sl %%screens[s|l]%%''
<p indent>
This option specifies the number of lines in the terminal buffer beyond the
length of the window.  The option value consists of a number followed by an
optional suffix.  If no suffix is included, or the suffix is "l" (ell), the
total length of the terminal buffer will be !!screens!! plus the length of
the terminal window.  If the suffix is "s" (ess), the total length of the
terminal buffer will be (!!screens!! plus one) times the length of the

pixels, and drawn with it's top on the baseline.  The default is
``char_cursor_box''.

``consoleMode''
<p indent>
This resource specifies that output directed at ``/dev/console'' should be
directed instead to the terminal window.  It is provided as a way to
prevent output that would normally be displayed on the ITE from 
overwriting the X server's display.  It is not provided as a
general mechanism to
direct the output from an arbitrary system's ``/dev/console'' to an
arbitrary X server.  Note that you must have ownership of and read/write
access to ``/dev/console'' for this option to work.
The default is False.

<p id=fg>``foreground''
<p indent>
This resource specifies the foreground color of the terminal window as well as
the default foreground color used for the scrollbar and the color used
for the pointer
cursor. Under CDE, this resource will default to the primary

used, the default will be the last component of the program's path. If
the ``-e'' option is not used, the default will be the base name of the
name used to execute ``dtterm'' (i.e., ``argv[0]'').

<p id=jumpScroll>``jumpScroll''
<p indent>
This resource specifies that jump scrolling should be used. Under jump
scrolling, the screen may be scrolled more than one line at a time. This
provides for faster screen updates when multiple lines of text are being
sent to the terminal. The maximum number of lines that may be jump
scrolled is limited to the number of lines in the display. It is guaranteed that
all lines will be displayed. The default is True.

<p id=kshMode>``kshMode''
<p indent>
This resource specifies that ksh mode should be enabled. Under ksh mode,
a key pressed with the extend modifier bit set will generate an escape
character followed by the character generated by the un-extended
keystroke. This option is provided for use with emacs and emacs command
line editor mode of ``ksh(1)'' or ``ied(1)''. It conflicts with the
normal use of the meta key for generating extended single byte
characters and for generating multi-byte Asian characters. The default
is False.

<p id=logfile>``logFile''
<p indent>
This resource specifies the name of the file to which the output log described
below is written.  If the file name begins with a pipe symbol (``|''), the
rest of the string is assumed to be a command to be used as the endpoint of
a pipe. The default filename is ``DttermLog''%%XXXXX%% (where %%XXXXX%%
is a unique character string) and is created in the directory from
which the subprocess was started.
If the last five characters are "XXXXX," they
are replaced by a unique character string.
<p id=logging>``logging''
<p indent>
This resource enables output logging. When logging is enabled, all
output received from the subprocess is logged either to a file or to a
command pipeline (as specified via the ``logFile'' option above). Since
the data is being logged directly from the subprocess, it includes all
escape characters and carriage return/newline pairs sent by the terminal
line discipline. Output may be enabled and disabled via 
escape sequences. The default is
False.

``logInhibit''
<p indent>
This resource specifies that device and file logging should be inhibited.
The default is False.

<p id=logShell>``loginShell''
<p indent>
This resource specifies that the shell that is started should be a login
shell (i.e. the first character of ``argv[0]'' will be a dash, indicating
to the shell that it should read the system's ``profile'' and the user's 
``$HOME/.profile'' (for ``ksh'' and ``sh'') or the system's ``csh.login'' and
the user's ``$HOME/.login'' (for ``csh'').  The default is False.

<p id=maponout>``mapOnOutput''
<p indent>
This resource indicates that the terminal emulator should map
(de-iconify) itself upon subprocess output if it is unmapped (iconified). An
initial period of time during which it will not map itself upon subprocess
output may be specified via the ``mapOnOutputDelay'' resource (see
below). The default is False.

<p id=maponoutdlay>``mapOnOutputDelay''
<p indent>
This resource specifies the number of seconds after start-up that
``dtterm'' will not honor the ``mapOnOutput'' resource (see above). This
allows for initial output (e.g., shell prompts) to be sent to the
terminal without auto mapping the window. The default is ``0'' (no delay)

<p id=marginBell>``marginBell''
<p indent>
Specifies whether or not the bell should be run when the user types near
the right margin. The default is False.

<p id=menuresource>``menuBar''
<p indent>
This resources specifies that a pulldown menu should be displayed.  The
default is True.

<p id=menuPopup>``menuPopup''
<p indent>
This resources specifies that a popup menu should be enabled.  The
default is True.

<p id=nMarginBell>``nMarginBell''
<p indent>
Specifies the number of characters from the right margin at which the
margin bell should be rung, when enabled.  The default is 10.

<p id=pointblank>``pointerBlank''
<p indent>
This resource specifies that the pointer cursor should be put into
blanking mode. In this mode, the cursor will turn on when the pointer is
moved, and will be blanked either after a selectable number of seconds
or after keyboard input has occurred. The delay is set via the
``pointerBlankDelay'' resource (see below). The default is False.

<p id=pointblankdelay>``pointerBlankDelay''
<p indent>
This resource defines the number of seconds to wait before blanking the
pointer cursor after the pointer has been moved.  A value of 0 invokes
pointer blanking only on keyboard input.  The default is 2
seconds.

<p id=pointcolor>``pointerColor''
<p indent>
This resource specifies the foreground color to use for the terminal
window's pointer (X11) cursor.  The default is to use the terminal window's
foreground color.  See <link fg>``foreground''<\link> above.

``pointerColorBackground''
<p indent>
This resource specifies the background color to use for the terminal
windows pointer (X11) cursor. The default is to use the terminal windows
background color See <link background>``background''<\link> above.

``pointerShape''
<p indent>
This resource specifies the X cursor font character to use as the pointer
cursor.  It should be specified as a string from the include file
``&<X11/cursorfont.h>'' with the leading ``XC_'' removed.  The default is
``xterm''.

``reverseVideo''
<p indent>
This resource specifies whether or not reverse video should be
used. The default is False.

<p id=reverseWrap>``reverseWrap''
<p indent>
This resource specifies whether or not reverse-wraparound should be
enabled. The default is False.

<p id=savelines>``saveLines''
<p indent>
This resource specifies the number of lines in the terminal buffer beyond
length of the window.  The value value consists of a number followed by an
optional suffix.  If no suffix is included, or the suffix is "l" (ell), the
total length of the terminal buffer will be !!screens!! plus the length of
the terminal window.  If the suffix is "s" (ess), the total length of the
terminal buffer will be (!!screens!! plus one) times the length of the
terminal window.  ``dtterm'' will try to maintain the same buffer-to-window
ratio when the window is resized larger.  The default is "4s."

<p id=scrollbar>``scrollBar''
<p indent>
This resource specifies whether or not the scrollbar should be visible.
The
default is True.

<p id=sunfnctk>``sunFunctionKeys''
<p indent>
Specifies whether or not Sun Function Key escape codes should be
generated for function keys instead of standard VT220 escape sequences.
The default is False.

<p id=termid>``termId''
<p indent>
This resource supplies the name used to select the correct response to
terminal ID queries.  Valid values are ``vt100'', ``vt101'', ``vt102'',
and ``vt220''.  The default is ``vt220''.

<p id=termname>``termName''
<p indent>
This resource defines the name for the
``$TERM''
environment variable. The default is ``vt220''.

<p id=title>``title''
<p indent> 
This resource specifies the window title. If the ``-e'' option is used,
the default will be the last component of the program's path. If the
``-e'' option is not used, the default will be the last component of the
name used to execute ``dtterm'' (i.e., ``argv[0]'').

<p id=ttymodes>``ttyModes'' 
<p indent>
This resource specifies a string containing terminal-setting keywords
and the characters to which they may be bound.  Allowable keywords
include: ``intr, quit, erase, kill, eof, eol, swtch, start, stop, brk,
susp, dsusp, rprnt, flush, weras'', and ``Inext''.  Keywords that do not
apply to a specific architecture will be correctly parsed and ignored.  Control characters may
be specified as ``^''followed by ``char'' (e.g. ``^c'' or ``^u)'', and ``^?''
may be used to indicate
delete.  This is very useful for overriding the default terminal
settings without having to do an ``stty'' every time a terminal process 
is started. The default is NULL.

``userBoldFont''
<p indent>
This resource specifies an XFontSet to be used when displaying bold
terminal text.  It should be specified as a Motif ``XmFontList''.  Only
character or mono spaced fonts are supported. The behavior when using
proportional fonts is undefined.  A default bold font will be generated
based on the XLFD name of the ``userFont''.  If that font is not available,
bold text will be generated by overstriking (with a one pixel offset) the
``userFont''.

<p id=userFont>
``userFont''
<p indent>
This resource specifies an XFontSet to be used when displaying 
terminal text.  It should be specified as a Motif ``XmFontList''.  Only
character or mono spaced fonts are supported. The behavior when using
proportional fonts is undefined.  This font will not be used to display
non-terminal text (menu bar, popup menu, dialog, etc.).  The default is to
use the ``XmNtextFontList'' value of the parent bulletin board (see
XmBulletinBoard(3X)) in the same manner as the ``XmText'' widget.

<p id=visbell>
``visualBell''
<p indent>
This resource specifies that a visual bell is preferred over an audible
one.  Instead of ringing the terminal bell whenever a CTRL-G is received,
the windows will be flashed.  The default is False.

<s2 id=pointerusage>POINTER USAGE
``dtterm''
allows you to select regions of text.  Selection is based on the model
specified in the <book|Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual|
(ICCCM).  ``dtterm'' supports primary selection only.  You can copy or
paste selected text using primary transfer.  Input is treated as keyboard
input, and is inserted at the cursor.  The select/insert operations and their
default assignments are described below.

<lablist>
\<term nogloss|select|\The left button is used to select the text
to be copied.  Move
the pointer to the beginning of the text to copy, press and hold the left
button, move the cursor to the end of the text to copy, and release the
button.  Any currently selected text can be deselected by clicking the left
button once without moving the mouse.

\<term nogloss|insert|\The middle button pastes the text from the primary selection,
treating it as keyboard input.
<\lablist>
