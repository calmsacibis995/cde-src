A ++terminal emulator++ is an application that displays a window where 
you can use UNIX commands, and cut and paste text within or between terminal
emulation windows.

The command-line prompt is a special character that is displayed in your
Terminal window after you press [[Return]].  It can be a ``%'', ``<'',
``$'', or other special character.  A small box or bar, called a cursor, 
shows where characters appear in the window when you type something
on the keyboard.

The command-line prompt and cursor appear in terminal windows.
&ProductName; provides  a ``dtterm'' terminal emulator by default.  It
displays a
window in which command-line prompts and function keys act like a DEC VT220
terminal.
The ``dtterm'' terminal emulator 
emulates that portion of the VT220 terminal that is consistent with ANSI
and ISO standards.
