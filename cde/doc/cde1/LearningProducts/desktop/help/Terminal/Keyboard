<chapter id=KeyboardInfo>dtterm Keyboard Information
<idx|keyboard information|

This topic contains a list of keyboard functionality associated with dtterm.
It
includes only the keys that are special for dtterm.  They apply only
when the terminal text area has the keyboard focus.  They do !!not!!
apply when a dialog, pulldown, or popup menu has the keyboard focus.
In some cases, additional modifiers
are ignored. For example, the description for F1 does not apply to Shift
F1, but the description of Tab applies to both Tab and Shift Tab.
