<s1 id=ToLogIntoASessionTA>To Log In to a Desktop Session

        <idx|logging in to a desktop session|

<list order>

* Type your user ID and
  press Return or click OK.

* Type your password and press Return
  or click OK.

<\list>

If Login Manager does not recognize your user ID or password, 
try again.


<note>
To change the session startup option, choose Session from the Options
menu and select one of the following:

<list bullet>

* Common Desktop Environment (CDE)
* OpenWindows Desktop
* User's Last Desktop
* Failsafe Session

<\list>
<\note>

When you log in, Session Manager starts a session:

<list bullet>

* If this is the first time you have logged in, starts a new session.

* If you have logged in before, your previous session is restored.

<\list>


<s1 id=ToLogOutTA>To Log Out of a Desktop Session

        <idx|logging out of desktop session|
        <idx|session:ending|
        <idx|Front Panel:exit control|
        <idx|Workspace menu:logout command|

<list bullet>

* Click the exit control in the Front Panel.

* !!Or,!! choose Log out from the Workspace menu (displayed by pressing
    mouse button 3).

<\list>

When you log out of a regular desktop session, Session Manager
saves information about your current session so that information can be
restored the next time you log in.


<s1 id=ToLogIntoDifferentLanguageSessionTA>To Use a Session in a Different Language

        <idx|language: different|
        <idx|session:in different languages|

<list order>

* Choose Language from the Options menu on the login screen.

* Choose the language group that includes the language you need.

* From the menu of languages in the group, choose the language 
  you need.
  When you choose the language, the login screen will be
  redisplayed in the selected language.

* Log in.

<\list>

The default language for your system is set by your system administrator.
The Options menu enables you to access other languages.
Choosing a language in the Language menu sets the LANG environment variable
for your session.  The default language is restored at the end of the session.


<s1 id=ToLogIntoFailsafeTA>To Log In to and Out of a Failsafe Session

        <idx|logging into and out of failsafe session|
        <idx|failsafe session: logging in and out|
        <idx|terminal emulator:in failsafe session|

A failsafe session is a simple session that 
optionally starts a single Terminal window.
It is useful when you need access to a single Terminal window to
execute several commands before logging in to a desktop session.
 

<procedure>To Log In

<list order>

* On the login screen, Choose Session from the Options menu.

* Choose Failsafe Session from the Session submenu.

* Log in.

<\list>


<procedure>To Log Out

<list bullet>

* Type the <computer>exit<\computer> command in the Terminal window.

<\list>


<s1 id=ToEnterCommandLineLoginTA>To Enter Command Line Login Mode

        <idx|X server: stopping temporarily|
        <idx|using: Command Line Login mode|
        <idx|Command Line Login mode|

<list order>

* On the login screen, choose Command Line Login from the Options menu.
 The login screen disappears and is replaced by a console prompt.

* Supply your user ID and password as prompted.

<\list>

Command Line Login mode is not a desktop session.  When your system is
in Command Line Login mode, the desktop is suspended.  You log in using your
operating system mechanism rather than Login Manager. There are no
windows because the X server is not running.

<note>
Certain types of configurations (for example, Xterminals) do
not provide a Command Line Login mode option. Command-line Login mode
is not available if you start dtlogin as root. 
<\note>


<s1 id=ToLeaveCommandLineLoginTA>To Leave Command Line Login Mode

        <idx|using: Command Line Login mode|
        <idx|Command Line Login mode|

<list bullet>

* Type <computer>exit<\computer> from the command-line prompt.

<\list>


<s1 id=ToSaveHomeSessionTA>To Save a Home Session

        <idx|saving: home session|
        <idx|home session: saving|

<list order>

* Click the Style Manager control in the Front Panel.

* Click the Startup control in Style Manager.

* Click Set Home session in the Startup dialog box.

<s1 id=ToDecideOnSessionAtLogout>To Choose between the Current and Home Session when You Log Out

        <idx|choosing: between current and home session|
        <idx|current and home session: choosing between|
        <idx|home and current session: choosing between|

<list order>

<\list>

With Ask Me at Logout selected, when you log out the log out
confirmation window asks if you want to save the current session and
return to it upon login or if you want to return to the last saved
home session the next time you log in.  If you choose to return to the
home session, the current session information is not saved.

<s1 id=ToSetPersonalVariablesTA>To Set Personal Environment Variables

        <idx|setting: personal environment variables|
        <idx|personal environment variables: setting|
        <idx|environment variables: setting personal|
        <idx|variables, environment: setting personal|



Personal environment variables can be set in the script file
<computer>HomeDirectory/.dtprofile<\computer>.

<list order>
* Edit %%HomeDirectory%%/.dtprofile
* Add lines to the file to set the environment variable
  
<\list>
The desktop will accept either sh or ksh syntax for the commands in this
file.  The commands should only be those that set environment
variables, not any that perform terminal I/O, ex.  "tset" or "stty".

<note>
By default, the files <computer>HomeDirectory/.profile<\computer> and
<computer>HomeDirectory/.login<\computer> are
NOT read by the desktop, as they may contain terminal I/O based command
inappropriate for a graphical interface. These files ARE read if the
last line of <computer>.dtprofile<\computer> is uncommented; the line reads
<computer>DTSOURCEPROFILE=true<\computer>. See <xref
ToUseAShellFileTA>. 
<\note>

<p>
The desktop automatically
sets the following environment variables for each user:
<lablist>   
\DISPLAY\ set to the value of the first field in the Xservers file
\EDITOR\ set to the desktop default editor
\HOME\ set to the user's home directory (from /etc/passwd)
\KBD_LANG\ set to the value of $LANG for some languages (see Xsession)
\LANG\ set to the display's current NLS language (if any)
\LC_ALL, LC_MESSAGES\ set to the value of $LANG
\LOGNAME\  set to the user name
\MAIL\ set to "/var/mail/$USER"
\PATH\ set to the value of the Dtlogin "userPath" resource
\USER\ set to the user name
\SHELL\ set to the user's default shell (from /etc/passwd)
\TERM\ set to dtterm
\TZ\  set to the system's zone or to the value of the Dtlogin "timeZone" resource

<\list>


<s1 id=ToUseAShellFileTA>To Use Your Existing .profile or .login File

        <idx|using: shell environment file with ``.dtprofile''|
        <idx|shell environment file, using with ``.dtprofile''|
        <idx|environment file, shell, using with ``.dtprofile''|

If you have an existing shell environment file (``.profile'' or ``.login''),
this procedure lets you continue to use that file.  This will avoid duplicate
variable assigments between ``.dtprofile'' and the shell environment file.
With minor editing, you can adapt 
<computer>HomeDirectory/.profile (or .login)<\computer>
for use both with and without the desktop. 
   

<list order>
* Edit the <computer>.profile or .login<\computer> to provide two sections:

<list bullet>
   * One section contains commands that do not apply to the desktop (for
     example, commands that require terminal I/O, or variables for which
     you want to replicate the desktop default values). 
     Enclose them with an "if" statement that checks for the setting of 
 the "DT" environment variable.

   * The other section contains variables that apply, whether or not the desktop
     is run.
<\list>

*  Modify <computer>.dtprofile<\computer> to source in the shell
   environment file by uncommenting the following line at the 
   bottom on the <computer>.dtprofile<\computer> file.

<ex smaller>
DTSOURCEPROFILE=true
<\ex>

* Log in again


<\list>
<need begin>
The following sample shows how to separate it into a non-desktop
section and a section for variables that apply to both environments.




<procedure>example for sh/ksh
<ex smaller>   
  #
  #  commands and environment variables used when logging in without 
  #  the desktop
  #
  if [ ! "$DT" ]; then
    stty ...
    tset ...
    DISPLAY=mydisplay:0
    MAIL=/usr/mail/$USER
    EDITOR=/bin/vi
	        ...
  fi	    

  #
  # environment variables common to both desktop and non-desktop 
  #
  PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH
       ...
<\ex>	  
<procedure>example for csh
<ex>
  #
  #  commands and environment variables used when logging in without 
  #  the desktop
  #
  if ( ! ${?DT} ) then
     stty ...
     tset ...
     setenv DISPLAY mydisplay:0
     setenv MAIL /usr/mail/$USER
     setenv EDITOR /bin/vi
         ...
  fi
  #
  # environment variables common to both desktop and non-desktop
  #
  setenv PATH $HOME/bin:$PATH
 
<\ex>

<note>
Errors in .dtprofile or .profile (.login) may prevent a successful
login. If so, log in via the failsafe session and correct the error.
To see errors in a failsafe session, view the
<computer>$HOME/.dt/startlog<\computer> file. 
<\note>

<note>
If a terminal emulator is started with the ``-ls'' option, ``.login'' or
``.profile'' will be read automatically.
