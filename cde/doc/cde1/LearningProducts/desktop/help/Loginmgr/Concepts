<s1 id=SessionsSI>Introducing Desktop Sessions

        <idx|starting: Desktop session|
        <idx|logging into Desktop session|
        <idx|Desktop: starting session|

A session is the collection of applications, settings and resources
that are present on your desktop. 
A desktop session occurs between the time you log in and 
the time you log out. The login screen, created by the Login Manager, is
your gateway to the desktop.  It provides a place for you
to type your user ID and password.

The Options menu on the login screen lists your options.  In addition
to running a desktop session -- CDE or OpenWindows -- you can choose
to run a failsafe session.  You can also select the language for your
session.

After Login Manager authenticates your user ID and password, Session
Manager takes over.
Session management is a set of
conventions and protocols that allow a special session manager such as
the Common Desktop Environment Session Manager
to save and restore your session. You can log
into your system and be presented with the same set of running
applications, settings and resources as were present when you
logged out. 
Session Manager saves and restores:

<list bullet>

* The appearance and behavior settings&emdash;for example, fonts, colors,
  and mouse settings.

* The window applications that were running&emdash;for example, your File
  Manager and Text Editor windows.  Certain types of applications cannot be
  saved and restored by Session Manager.  For example, if you start the 
  <computer>vi<\computer>
  editor from a command line in a Terminal window, Session Manager cannot
  restore your editing session.

When you log into the desktop for the first time, a
default initial session is loaded. Afterward,
the Session Manager supports the notion of a current and a home session. 


<procedure>Initial Session
When you log into the desktop for the first time,
the Session Manager generates your initial session using system default values.
By default, File Manager and an Introduction to Common Desktop Environment
are automatically started.

<procedure>Current Session
Ordinarily, the desktop saves session information when you log out and uses
that information to start your next session.  If you start or stop applications
during your session, or use Style Manager to change the appearance and
behavior of your system, changes you make are reflected in your next
session.  

Your running session is always considered the ++current
session++, whether restored upon login from a saved home
session, a saved current session or the system default
initial session.  Based on your Style Manager Startup
settings, when you exit the session, Session
Manager automatically saves the current session.  When you
next log into the desktop, your previously saved current session
is restored.  This means that the desktop will be restored to same state
as it was when the you last logged out.


<procedure>Home Session
The desktop also provides a ++home session++.  A home session is a
session that you explicitly save.  It's like taking a snapshot of your
current session at some point in time.  Once you've saved a home session,
you can specify that the desktop restores that session instead of
the current session the next time you log in.

<s1 id=StartOtherTypesSessionsSI>Other Ways to Log In

        <idx|session: types other than Regular|
        <idx|starting: failsafe session|
        <idx|starting: Command Line Login mode session|
        <idx|failsafe session: starting|
        <idx|Command Line Login mode: starting session|

In addition to the CDE desktop session, there are additional types of 
sessions, available from the Options menu of the login screen:

<lablist>

\ Command Line Login \ Command Line Login lets you temporarily leave the
        desktop to work in your system console. This option is
disabled if you start dtlogin as root. (See <xref ToEnterCommandLineLoginTA>.)

\ OpenWindows Desktop \ Available from the Session submenu, this option
allows you to start an OpenWindows session.

\ User's Last Desktop \ Available from the Session submenu, this option
allows you to start whatever type of desktop you last used. 

\ Failsafe Session \ A failsafe session provides a Terminal window. 
It is useful for executing several commands before
        logging in to another desktop session.
        (See <xref ToLoginToFailsafeTA>.)
