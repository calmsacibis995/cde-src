Keyboard shortcuts offer a way to accomplish desktop tasks such 
as moving and selecting windows and controls, choosing menus, and 
navigating in workspaces without the use of your mouse.

When you use the keyboard to navigate on the desktop, note that:
 
<list bullet tight>
<item> Alt is the same as Extend char on some keyboards.
<item> Return is the same as Enter on some keyboards.
<item> In Style Manager, the Window Behavior setting must be "Click In Window 
 To Make Active" (this is the default).
