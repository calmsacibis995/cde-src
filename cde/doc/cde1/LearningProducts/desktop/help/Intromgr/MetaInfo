there are some hyperlinks that open a new window because they jump to the

<newline>&empty;

CDE supports the use of both two- and three-button mouse devices. 
The functions associated with mouse buttons change depending on the 
type of mouse being used.

<p gentity=MiceButtons gposition=left>
<term nogloss>Two-button Mouse:<\term><newline>
Button 1 = Select & Transfer<newline>
Button 2 = Menu<newline>&empty;<newline>
<term nogloss>Three-button Mouse:<\term><newline>
Button 1 = Select & Transfer<newline>
Button 2 = Transfer or Adjust<newline>
Button 3 = Menu

<emph>Select<\emph> is used to choose or activate objects such as controls, 
windows, and icons.  <emph>Transfer<\emph> refers to <term "drag">drag and 
drop<\term> functionality.  The <emph>Adjust<\emph> function (also known 
as <quote>extend<\quote>) allows you to extend  selections in a 
multiple-selection list or extend text selection in text fields. This is 
comparable to using Shift+mouse button 1. 

Note that some Transfer functionality, such as Primary-Copy and
Quick-Copy, is not available when you're using a two-button mouse. Instead, use 
an application's copy and paste functions.

<procedure>Applications and Two-button Mouse Devices

If you're using a two-button mouse with CDE applications that have pop-up menus, 
press mouse button 2 to display the pop-up menu attached to an object (for 
example, an icon in the File Manager window).

Some applications that do not have pop-up menus may continue to use mouse
button 2 as Transfer. These include many existing Motif applications.

OpenWindows applications use the same mouse button functions as CDE applications.
On a two-button mouse, clicking mouse button 2 displays a pop-up menu, wherever 
such a menu is available.  For example, clicking mouse button 2 when the pointer 
is over the workspace backdrop displays the Workspace menu. 

The Style Manager Mouse dialog box options change according  to the type of mouse 
you are using. If you're using a three-button mouse, you can set mouse button 2 to 
either Transfer or Adjust. On a two-button mouse, mouse button 2 is always Menu.

<procedure>Mouse Button References in Help Volumes

Much of the information presented in the online help describes the use of 
a three-button mouse.  If you have a two-button mouse, use mouse button 1 as 
described and substitute mouse button 2 for mouse button 3.
