Windows and dialog boxes contain controls that help you work with 
applications.  You use controls to manipulate objects, select choices, 
or type information.

Here's a list of the most common controls:

<list>
<item> Buttons initiate commands, start <term action>actions<\term>, or 
 specify options and settings.  Types of buttons include 
 <term "push button">push buttons<\term> and  
 <term "radio button">radio buttons<\term>. 

<item> <term "check box">Check boxes<\term> specify options and settings.
  
<item> Text fields provide an area where you can type information.

<item> Lists display a scrollable list of choices from which you can 
 select.

<item> Sliders provide incremental selection from a range of values.
<\list>

Choosing a push button immediately performs the associated command or 
action.  For example, choosing an OK button applies any changes made 
to a dialog box, then closes it.

As a shortcut, many dialog boxes automatically give focus to the OK button 
so that you can quickly specify settings and then press Return to 
choose OK.

Menus provide access to commands you use to manage windows and operate 
software applications.

Choosing a menu item performs an associated action on the currently 
selected object.  For example, when you select a window and choose Minimize 
from its Window menu, the window becomes an icon.

Menu items that appear dimmed are available only under certain conditions.
For example, the Window menu's Restore item is available only 
when the window is an icon.

Menus you'll use on the desktop include:

<p gentity=WindowMenu gposition=left><newline>
<newline> The Window menu lists items you use to control 
 windows and window icons.<newline>
 <newline>This menu is displayed when you:  click the Window menu button in 
 the upper left corner of a window, click on a window icon, press Alt+Spacebar 
 with the keyboard focus on a window or window icon.

<p gentity=WorkspaceMenu gposition=left><newline>
 The Workspace menu lists items for managing the 
 workspace and a submenu for starting applications.<newline>
