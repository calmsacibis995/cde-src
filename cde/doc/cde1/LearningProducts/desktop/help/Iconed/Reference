<s1 id=IconSearchPathsSI>Icon Search Paths
     <idx|search paths: for icons|
     <idx|icons: search paths|

The search path for image files is defined by two environment variables:

The system uses DTUSERAPPSEARCHPATH and DTAPPSEARCHPATH unless
the following variables exist:

<lablist>

\ DTUSERICONSEARCHPATH \ A personal variable.  If used, it
          should be defined in ``/%%HomeDirectory%%/.dtprofile''.

\ DTICONSEARCHPATH     \ A system-wide variable.

<\lablist>


<s2 id=DefaultIconSearchPath>Default Search Path

The default value for DTICONSEARCHPATH is:

<ex>
``/%%HomeDirectory%%/.dt/icons''
``/etc/dt/appconfig/icons/C''
``/usr/dt/appconfig/icons/C''
<\ex>


<s2 id=AddDirectorytoPersonalSearchPathDE>To Modify the Personal Icon Search Path

     <idx|adding: directory to actions search path|
     <idx|directory: adding to actions search path|
     <idx|action: search path, adding directory|
     <idx|search path, actions|
     <idx|path: actions search path|
     <idx|DTACTIONSEARCHPATH environment variable|
     <idx|environment variable: DTACTIONSEARCHPATH|


To add a directory to the search path,
edit ``/%%HomeDirectory%%/.dtprofile''.  Add a line defining a value for
the DTUSERICONSEARCHPATH:

        <ex>
        DTUSERICONSEARCHPATH=%%path%% [,%%path%% ...]
        <\ex>


<s2 id=AddDirectorytoSystemSearchPathDE>To Modify the System-wide Icon Search Path

System-wide search path variables are defined in files located in
the ``/etc/dt/Xsession.d'' directory.

<list bullet>
* If DTICONSEARCHPATH is already defined in a file in this directory,
  edit the value to add the new directory on the search path.

* If DTICONSEARCHPATH is not already defined in this directory, define
  it to include the default search path plus others you want to add.
  (The default search path is listed in comments in the file
  ``/usr/dt/bin/dtsearchpath''.)

                Editor warns you that the changes will be lost if you
                continue and exit.  To save the changes, choose
                Cancel, and then save your icon.)

                Cuts the selected area from the icon. The region removed

                Pastes the contents of the clipboard into the icon.
                (See <xref ToCopyPartOfAnIconTA>
                or <xref ToMovePartOfAnIconTA>.)

 \ Rotate Area \                <location id=rotate>&empty;<\location>
                Rotates the selected area to the left or right 90
                degrees.  Choose the direction from the submenu.
                (See <xref ToRotatePartOfAnIconTA>.)

 \ Flip Area \                  <location id=flip>&empty;<\location>
                Creates a mirror image of the selected area by flipping it
                vertically or horizontally.  Choose the direction

                icon as the "hotspot."  After choosing Add Hotspot,
                click the pixel you want to be the hotspot.

                Hotspots are used when
                creating images for mouse pointers -- the hotspot
                represents the !!actual!! location of the pointer.
                (See <xref ToAddAHotSpotTA>.)

                (See <xref ToCopyPartOfTheDisplayTA>.)
                The X-Y Size display above the work area shows the size
                in pixels of the area being grabbed.

                        <list bullet tight>

                         * XBM for two-color X bitmap format.  Bitmap files
                           are normally identified by a ``.bm'' file-name
                           suffix.

                         * XPM for multicolor X pixmap format (the
                           default).  Pixmap files are normally identified
                           by a ``.pm'' file-name suffix.

                        <\list>

                        See <xref ToSaveAnIconTA>.

 \ Magnification \      Changes the viewing size of the image in the
                        drawing area. You can choose magnification
                        factors from 2x (twice normal size) to 12x (twelve
                        times normal size).
