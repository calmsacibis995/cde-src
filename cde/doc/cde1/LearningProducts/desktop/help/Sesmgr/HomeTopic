The Session Manager is started when you log into the desktop.  It is
responsible for restarting applications and restoring colors, fonts, and
other aspects of appearance and behavior.  Session Manager
also starts Workspace Manager.

You can choose to have Session Manager restore:
<list bullet>
* The state of your session as it was the last time you logged out.  This
is called the ++current session++. 
* A particular session that you explicitly stored.  This is called a 
++home session++.  
<\list>

<list bullet>
 * <xref configureSessionMgr>.
 * <xref reference>.
