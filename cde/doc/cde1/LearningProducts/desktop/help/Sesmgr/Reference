[MODULE SessionManagerResourcesSI SErres.SIa]
<s1 id=SessionManagerResourcesSI>Session Manager Resources

``Dtsession*alarmTime''

<p indent>Specifies (in seconds) the amount of time before the lock dialog
	  is removed from the screen.  When the display is locked, the
	  pointer shows a lock cursor, and a dialog appears which asks for
	  the user password.  If no activity from the pointer or keyboard
	  is detected for ``alarmTime'' seconds, the dialog is removed from
	  the screen.  The lock dialog is redisplayed as soon as a pointer
	  or keyboard event is detected.  An ``alarmTime'' of 0 leaves the
	  lock dialog in place for the entire time the display is locked.
	  The default value is 10 seconds.

``Dtsession*colorUse''

<p indent>This resource specifies the number of colors to use for the user interface.

Valid types are:

<lablist>

\``B_W'' \ Specifies a black and white system.	The color palettes will use
	   two color cells for the user interface.  In this configuration
	   only two color palettes are available: BlackWhite and
	   WhiteBlack.	These palettes cannot dynamically change.

\``LOW_COLOR''\Specifies a low color system.  The color palettes will have
	       two color sets and use a maximum of 12 color cells for the
	       user interface, including black and white (color cells 0 and
	       1).  The number of color cells can be reduced by using the
	       resources ``ShadowPixmaps'' and ``ForegroundColor''.

\``MEDIUM_COLOR''\ Specifies a medium color system.  The color palettes
		   will have 4 color sets and use a maximum of 22 color
		   cells for the user interface, including black and white
		   (color cells 0 and 1).  The number of color cells can be
		   reduced by using the resources ``ShadowPixmaps'' and
		   ``ForegroundColor''.

\``HIGH_COLOR'' \ Specifies a high color system.  The color palettes will
		  have 8 color sets and use a maximum of 42 color cells for
		  the user interface, including black and white (color
		  cells 0 and 1).  The number of color cells can be reduced
		  by using the resources ``ShadowPixmaps'' and
		  ``ForegroundColor''.

<\lablist>

``Dtsession*coverScreen''

<p indent>This resource specifies whether or not the screens of the display
	  will be covered when the display is locked.  The default value is
	  False, which means that the screens will not be covered.

``Dtsession*dynamicColor''

<p indent>This resource can have values of True or False and is used to
	  reduce the number of color cells being used.	Once a palette has
	  been selected and the user will not be changing palettes often,
	  ``dynamicColor'' can be set to False.	 When the session comes up
	  next time, the color server will use Read Only color cells that
	  can be shared by non-Motif1.1 clients, thus reducing the total
	  number of color cells used.  The default value is True.

``Dtsession*foregroundColor''

<p indent> This resource can have values of White, Black or Dynamic.
	   ``ForegroundColor'' causes all text (foreground) to use either
	   pixel 0 or 1 (Black or White) or to have a color cell dedicated
	   to foreground and changes in response to the background color
	   (Dynamic) for each ColorSet.	 If set to White or Black, the
	   number of color cells used per ColorSet is reduced by 1.

``Dtsession*keys''

<p indent> This resource is a list of "keyholders" who have the ability to
	   unlock the screen any time it is locked by the user.	 The list
	   is a list of user id's separated by commas.

``Dtsession*queryServerSettings''

<p indent>This resource specifies whether Session Manager queries the
	  server at logout for all its settings or saves only those
	  settings set by using Style Manager.  Querying the
	  server ensures that all settings are saved; however, there is a
	  degradation in performance when a full query is done.	 The
	  default value is False, which means that the server will not be
	  queried.

``Dtsession*shadowPixmaps''

<p indent>On color systems, this resource can have a value of True or
	  False.  If True, ``topShadowColor'' and ``bottomShadowColor'' use
	  the same pixel as background and ``topShadowPixmap'' and
	  ``bottomShadowPixmap'' are specified instead of solid color to
	  create the 3D look.  This reduces the number of color cells per
	  ColorSet by 2.  ``ShadowPixmaps'' defaults to True for systems
	  with 4 or less color planes (16 or less color cells), and False
	  for systems with more than 4 color planes.

``Dtsession*wmStartupCommand''

<p indent>Allows for an alternate window manager to be started at login.
	  If this display is NULL, Dtsession starts ``dtwm''.
	  Note that the command should not have any commands to a shell in
	  it, and that it should not be surrounded by quotes. 

``Dtsession*writeXrdbColors''

<p indent>This resource should only be used if you are running non Motif
	  1.1 clients that have color schemes that conflict with the desktop
	  colors.  This has no impact on clients linked with the Motif 1.1
	  library.  This resource specifies whether color resource
	  information should be written out.  If set to False,
	  ``background'' and ``foreground'' resources will not be written
	  out with the values of the current palette.  This means that non
	  Motif 1.1 clients will not get the desktop colors when they are
	  started.  The default value is True.

When a session is started this way, Session Manager is not
in charge of the logout process.

<term nogloss> Exiting the Desktop Session.<\term>
Exit means the same thing as logging out. You put your 
desktop away. This is a good thing to do for security 
reasons as no one can use your account or access your files.

<term nogloss> Application updates you have not saved may be lost.<\term>
Certain types of applications such as text editors, graphic editors, and 
some word processors, may require you to save 
before exiting your desktop . Some may have an 
auto-save capability. It varies from application to application, 
so you should know the saving conditions of your application.
When in doubt, you can always save any open data files.
In particular, be sure to save data in applications that run 
in terminal windows.

<term nogloss> Your current session will be saved and returned to 
upon your next login.<\term>
Starts your next session with the workspace contents exactly 
the way it is right now, including any setting, client or 
resource modification.

<term nogloss> Items in the Trash Can will be permanently shredded.<\term>
Items you dragged into the trash are removed as part of the
exit process. They will NOT be there the next time you log in.

<term nogloss> Continue Logout?<\term>
This is your last chance to go back to the desktop and do
a save or something else. Click Cancel to avoid logging out.

This confirmation box is displayed because you selected
Ask me at Logout in the Style Manager Startup dialog box.
You can use that dialog box to change the startup setting,
so that Session Manager automatically restores the current
or home session.
