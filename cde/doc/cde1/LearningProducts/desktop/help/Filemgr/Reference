To change mouse behavior<\link> in the Style Manager help volume
describes how to switch the order of the mouse buttons left-to-right.
 
<procedure>Mouse Button 1&emdash;Select and Drag
 
Mouse button 1 (the left button, by default) is used to select and drag	
objects.
 
Selecting objects:
 
<list bullet tight>
 
* Click an icon to select a single object.
 
* Place the mouse pointer in the background area, press and hold Mouse
  button 1, and then drag a box around multiple icons to select all
  the icons within the box.
 
* Hold down the Control key and click on another icon to add it
  to the current selection.  A second Control click on a selected
  object removes it from a group of selected objects.
 
<\list>
 
Selecting text:
 
<list bullet tight>
 
* Click an icon's name to edit it.  Press Return (Enter) when you are
  done editing.
 
* Click on a workspace's name in the Front Panel workspace buttons to edit it.

Mouse Button 2 can be changed so that click performs
to an adjust function.  This change can be done by using the mouse dialog in Style
Manager.  Adjust means that when you click mouse button 2 in the text, the end point of
the currently selected text will move to the where you clicked mouse button 2.
For example, if you insert the cursor in a word and then move the pointer
to the right 10 letters and click mouse button 2, all the letters between
the cursor and pointer will be selected.  If you click mouse button 2 again  
10 more letters to the right, all 20 letters are selected.
<\list>
 
To edit selected text:
 
<list bullet tight>
 
* Click to position the text cursor.
 
* Drag to select a range of text.
 
* Double-click to select an entire word.
 
* Triple-click to select an entire line.
 
* Quadruple-click to select an entire multiline field of text.
 
<\list>
 
Dragging objects:
 
<list bullet tight>
 
* Moving objects: hold mouse button 1 down while dragging an icon.  Release the
  button to drop.  (See <xref ToDropAnObjectTA>).
 
* Copy objects: press and hold down the Control key
  and drag using mouse button 1.  (See <xref ToCopyAnObjectTA>).
 
* Create a link: press and hold down the Shift key
  and drag using mouse button 1.  (See <xref ToCreateASymbolicLinkTA>.)
 
<\list>
 
<procedure>Mouse Button 2&emdash;Drag
 
Mouse button 2 (the middle button, by default) can be used to
drag and drop objects.
 
<list bullet tight>
 
* Moving objects: hold mouse button 2 down while dragging an icon.  Release the
  button to drop.  (See <xref ToDropAnObjectTA>.)
 
* Copy objects: press and hold down the Control key
  and drag using mouse button 2.  (See <xref ToCopyAnObjectTA>).
 
* Create a link: press and hold down the Shift key
  and drag using mouse button 2.  (See <xref ToCreateASymbolicLinkTA>.)
 
<\list>
 
By default, mouse button 2 click can also be used to transfer (copy) selected text.
 
<list bullet tight>
 
* Select some text using mouse button 1.  Move the mouse pointer to 
  where you want a copy of the selected text to be inserted and click mouse button 2.
 
<\list>
 

<procedure>Mouse Button 3&emdash;Menus
 
        <idx|context menus|
 
Mouse button 3 (the right button, by default) is used to display pop-up
menus.
 
<list bullet tight>
 
* Point to the object or area where the menu is available, then press
  !!and hold!! mouse button 3 to display a pop-up menu that will go away when you
  release the button.
 
* Point to the object or area where the menu is available, then click

                <location id=FileManagerPutOnDTCommand>&empty;<\location>
                Puts the selected object into the right
                corner of the workspace backdrop.  The
                location of the icon on the desktop is
                determined by the !!objectPlacement!!
                resource, which defaults to the
                top right corner of the screen.  (See
                <xref ToPutAnObjectOnTheDesktopTA> and
                <xref FMresourcesSI>.)

                dialog box for the selected
                object. You can switch this dialog box between one that displays the
                permissions for the object and one that displays other information. 
		The Properties command is available only
                when there is exactly one object
                selected.  (See <link hyperlink= "Sdtfprop _homeTopic">Properties Help <\link>.)
 
\ Select All \  <location id=FileManagerSelectAllCommand>&empty;<\location>
                Selects all objects in the current File Manager view.
                (See <xref ToSelectMultipleObjectsTA>.)
 
\ Deselect All\ <location id=FileManagerUnselectAllCommand>&empty;<\location>
                Deselects all objects in the current File Manager view.

 
\!!Actions!!\  If the object has any actions, they are appended to the
               bottom of the menu.  These are the same actions that
               appear in the object's pop-up menu.  Since the actions
               vary from object to object depending on data type,
               the contents of the actions portion of the menu
               varies. Some of these menu items are:

\ Print \ Prints the selected object. 

\ Open \ Opens the selected object.  

\ Eject \ Ejects the diskette or CD-ROM. Appears in 
		File Manager Menus for diskettes and
		CD-ROMs only.

	 diskette, or CD-ROM, using the same File Manager window

\ Open New View \ Opens up a view of a subfolder of a folder, or a folder on a
	 diskette or CD-ROM, using a new File Manager window.

The Trash Can is a special File Manager container of objects you've deleted.
Objects in the Trash Can can be:
 
<list bullet>
 
* Removed from your file system using the Shred command from
  the File menu.
 
* Put Back into the folder from which they were deleted using the
  Put Back command from the File menu.
 
<\list> 
 
<procedure>Trash Can Viewing Area

Use the Find Files or Folders dialog box to search a folder and the
folders it contains for files with a particular name or contents.
For task information, see <xref ToFindAFileByNameTA> or
<xref ToFindAFileByContentsTA>.
 
<lablist>
 
\File or Folder Name\
                Type the name of the file or folder you want
                to find.  You can use wildcard characters.  (See
                the discussion of Matching Patterns in <xref
                ToFindAFileByNameTA>).
 
\File Contents\ Find will search inside files and folders for the
                text you type in this field.  (See the discussion in
                <xref MatchingPatterns>). This is slower than Name search.
 
<!-- \Follow Links\  Choose On if you want the search to follow symbolic links
                (which may take longer).  Otherwise, choose Off. -->
 
\Search Folder\
                Type the path of the folder where you want the
                search to start.  The search will start at that
                folder and include all its subfolders.  The
                current folder name automatically appears when you
                first open the dialog box.
 
\Files Found\   Lists the files or folders found in the search.
                Double-click a file or folder in the list to open a new
                File Manager view showing that file or folder.
 
\Open Folder\   If a file is found,
                Opens a File Manager view of the folder containing the
                file that is selected in Files Found.  If a folder was found,
                the view is the contents of that folder.
 
\Put In Workspace\ Put the selected file or folder on the backdrop of
                the current workspace.
 
\Start\         Starts the search.
 
\Stop\          Stops a search in progress.  Note that this button can be
                used even when the hourglass cursor is shown.
 
\Cancel\        Stops a search in progress and closes the dialog box.

<s1 id=FMUnreadableFloppyDialogDE>File Manager Unreadable Floppy Dialog Box

File Manager displays the Unreadable Floppy dialog box if you choose 
Open Floppy after inserting a  
diskette that is either unformatted or is unreadable by the system. (For 
example, the system cannot read tar formats.) The 
Unreadable Floppy dialog box has the same warning, buttons, and formatting 
options as the Format Floppy dialog box has, and includes a message
informing you that the diskette is unreadable.

See <xref FMFormatFloppyDialogDE> for a snap of the Format Floppy dialog box
and for a description of the buttons and formatting options.

<!-- Resources and command syntax commented out per Dave T. and Anna E.
************************************************************
The following resources control the !!initial!! appearance and behavior of
File Manager.
 
You can override several of these resource values using command-line
options with the ``dtfile'' command.  (See <xref FMCommandSyntaxSI>.)
 
``Dtfile*appHeight: %%height%%<newline>
Dtfile*appWidth: %%width%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the default size of an Application Manager
        view window, where %%height%% and %%width%% are specified in
        pixels.  The default height is ``365''; the default width is ``365''.
  
``Dtfile*checkBrokenLink: %%seconds%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the time interval (in seconds) that determines
        how often File Manger checks open folders for broken links.
        The default is 180 seconds.
 
        <idx|performace: File Manager|
        <p indent>If the ``checkBrokenLink'' resource is set to ``0''
        (zero), File Manager does not automatically check for broken
        links, which may provide better performance on some systems.
 
``Dtfile*desktopIcon: [ large | small ]'
        <p indent>Specifies the size of the icon images used for objects on
        the desktop.  The default is ``large''.
 
 
``Dtfile*direction: [ ascending | descending ]''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the order used when sorting.  The default is
        ``ascending''.  The sorting criteria is determined by the ``order''
        resource.
 
 
``Dtfile*dirHeight:  %%height%%<newline>
Dtfile*dirWidth: %%width%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the default size of a folder view window, where
        %%height%% and %%width%% are specified in pixels.  The default
        height is ``305''; the default width is ``555''.  (Related Topics the
        ``appHeight'' and ``appWidth'' resources, above.)
 
 
``Dtfile*fileManagerIcon: %%filename%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the icon to display when a File Manager window
        is minimized.  The default value is ``home.i.bm''.
 
 
``Dtfile*grid: [ on | off ]''
 
        <p indent>Specifies whether or not to use a grid to arrange icons
        within a folder view.  If set ``on'', icons are automatically
        arranged in a sorted grid.  If set ``off'', icons are left exactly
        as you place them.  (The default is ``on''.)
 
 
``Dtfile*help_volume: %%helpvolume%%''
 
         <p indent>Specifies an alternate help volume.
 
     "help_volume", "Help_volume", XmRString, sizeof (char *),
     XtOffset (ApplicationArgsPtr, help_volume), XmRImmediate, (XtPointer)NULL,
 

``Dtfile*largeIconHeight:  %%height%%<newline>
Dtfile*largeIconWidth: %%width%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the maximum size of an icon, where
        %%height%% and %%width%% are specified in pixels. 
  
``Dtfile*maxDirectoryProcesses: %%processes%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the maximum number of background processes which
        may be devoted to folder activities (such as reading the
        folder, updating the folder, writing positional information
        for the folder, checking for broken links of checking for other
        folder updates).
 
 
``Dtfile*maxRereadProcesses: %%processes%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the maximum number of background processes
        which may be devoted folder reread activities (such as checking
        for broken links or checking for other folder updates).
 
 
``Dtfile*maxRereadProcsPerTick: %%processes%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the number of reread processes that may be
        started per reread timer tick.  In other words, the currently
        displayed folders will be checked for changes in a round-robin
        fashion, !!x!! folders per timer tick where !!x!! is equal to
        %%processes%%.
 
 
``Dtfile*moveThreshold: %%pixels%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the number of pixels you must move the pointer
        before an action is considered a "drag" or "move."  The default is
        4 pixels.
 
 
``Dtfile*objectPlacement:  %%primary%%  %%secondary%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies where objects are placed on the desktop when
        the Put On Desktop command is used.  Values for %%primary%% and
        %%secondary%% include ``top'' (arrange icons top to bottom),
        ``bottom'' (arrange icons bottom to top), ``left'' (arrange icons
        left to right), and ``right'' (arrange icons right to left).
 
        <p indent>The default value is ``top right'', which causes icons
        to be placed in the top-right corner of the screen, then stacked
        down the right edge as additional objects are placed on the
        desktop.
 
        <p indent>This resource is ignored if you drop an object on the
        desktop, because the location is determined when you drop.  (See
        <xref ToPutAnObjectOnTheDesktopTA>.)
 
``Dtfile*openDir: [ new | current ]''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the criteria for opening a folder on a
        double-click.  The default value of ``current'' opens the new
        folder in the current window.
 
        <p indent>The value ``new'' causes File Manager to open a new view
        for each folder.  It also restricts itself so that only a single
        view of each folder can be created.  If the view already exists
        but is not visible, File Manager ensures that it is visible by
        bringing it to the current workspace (if necessary) and raising it
        to the top of the window stack.
 
``Dtfile*order: [ file_type | alphabetical | date | size ]''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the criteria for sorting objects.  The
        direction of the sort is determined by the ``direction'' resource.
 
        <p indent>Sorting occurs automatically the first time a folder
        is displayed.  If the ``grid'' resource is set ``on'', then the
        folder is sorted each time a change is made to the folder.
        If the grid is off, then sorting occurs only when you choose the
        View&bigrightarrow;Clean Up command.
 
        The default value is ``alphabetical''.
 
``Dtfile*rereadTime:  %%seconds%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the time interval that determines how often
        File Manager checks the displayed folders for changes.  The
        default is 10 seconds.
 
        <p indent>If ``rereadTime'' is set to ``0'' (zero), File Manager
        does not automatically refresh folders.  To update a File
        Manager view, you must choose the Update command from
        the View menu
        or double-click the current folder icon (just left of
        the current folder path).
 
``Dtfile*restrictMode: [ True | False ]''
 
        <p indent>Specifies whether or not you can navigate out of your
        home folder.  The default is ``False''.
 
``Dtfile*rootTitle:  %%string%%''
        <p indent>Specifies a title to be displayed when a File Manager
        view is displaying the root folder (``/'').  The default is
        ``ROOT''.  The string is also used to identify the root folder
        if it is placed on the desktop.
 
``Dtfile*showFilesystem: [ True | False ]''
 
        <p indent>Specifies whether or not to display the current folder
        header.  The default is ``True'', which shows the path.
 
 ``Dtfile*smallIconHeight:  %%height%%<newline>
Dtfile*smallIconWidth: %%width%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the maximum size of a small icon, where
        %%height%% and %%width%% are specified in pixels. 
 
``Dtfile*title: %%string%%''
 
        <p indent>Specifies a title for File Manager windows.  By default,
        this resource is not set, which causes each File Manager to use the
        current folder name as its title.
 
``Dtfile*treeFiles: [ never | always | choose ]''
 
        <p indent>Controls whether files may be displayed in the folder
        tree mode.  The possible values correspond to the options under
        By Folder Tree in the Show box in the Set View Options dialog box.
 
        <lablist>
 
        \never\ Files are never displayed.  You may toggle between
                two folder states: partially expanded (folders
                only) and fully contracted.  This value is the same as the
                Folders only option.
 
        \always\ Files are always displayed.  You may toggle between
                two folder states: fully expanded and fully contracted.
                This value is the same as the Folders and Files option.
 
        \choose\ Files may or may not be displayed.  You may rotate
                between three folder states: partially expanded, fully
                expanded, and fully contracted.  This value is the same as
                the Folders, then Files option.
 
        <\lablist>
 
``Dtfile*treeView: [ on | off ]''
 
        <p indent>Determines whether files are displayed in single-folder
        mode (``on'') or folder-tree mode (``off'').
 
``Dtfile*view:  [ no_icon | small_icon | large_icon | attributes ]''
 
        <p indent>Specifies the style of view used to display a folder.
        The default is ``large_icon''.  These values correspond to the four
        choices in the View box within the Set View Options dialog box.

Where %%options%% includes the following:
 
<lablist>
 
\``-direction [ ascending | descending ]''\
                Specifies the order used when sorting.  The default is
                ``ascending''.  The sorting criteria is determined by the
                ``order'' resource.
 
\``-directory %%directory%%''\
                Specifies the initial %%folder%% to view.  If not
                specified, your current folder is displayed.  This
                option may be abbreviated as ``-dir %%directory%%''.
 
\``-grid [ on | off ]''\
                Specifies where objects are located in the folder
                view window.  If ``on'', the objects are always displayed
                in a grid pattern and rearranged, if necessary, when an
                object is moved.  If ``off'', objects are displayed
                where they are placed by the user and are never rearranged.
                The default is ``on''.
                
\``-large_icon_height %%height%%''\
                Specifies the maximum height in pixels for large icons.                
 
\``-large_icon_width %%width%%''\
                Specifies the maximum width in pixels for large icons.                  
 
\``-noview''\   Causes File Manager to run in server mode.  In other words,
                a window is not displayed until a user or another program
                makes a request to display a folder.
 
\``-order [ alphabetical | file_type | date | size ]''\
                Specifies the order in which to display objects.
 
\``-restricted''\
                Specifies that the File Manager is restricted to the
                initial folder.  You are allowed to navigate to
                subfolders, but not to any parent folder above
                the folder specified with ``-directory
                %%directory%%''.  Also in restricted mode, the path
                area (just below the menu bar) displays ``/.../'' to
                represent the path to the restricted folder.
 
\``-session %%session_file%%''\
                Specifies the session file to use when starting File
                Manager.  Session files are generated when you exit the
                File Manager.  
                
\``-small_icon_height %%height%%''\
                Specifies the maximum height in pixels for small icons.                
 
\``-small_icon_width %%width%%''\

\``-title %%title_name%%''\
                Specifies the title for the File Manager windows.  All
                windows and dialog boxes generated by this session of
                File Manager will use this title.  If no title is
                specified, the name of the current folder is used
                as the window title.
 
\``-tree [ on | off ]''\
                Specifies whether File Manager displays file in tree-view
                mode (``on'') or in single-folder mode (``off'').
 
\``-view [ no_icon | large_icon | small_icon | attributes ]''\
                Specifies the style of view used to display a folder.
                The default is ``large_icon''.  These values correspond
                to the four choices in the View box within the Set
                Preferences dialog box.
