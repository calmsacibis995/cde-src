   A key or combination of keys provided as a shortcut for choosing a
   command.  Accelerators are most commonly used with menu commands, but
   may also be used for other frequent actions.

<dterm>action
   A &ProductName; construct used to provide a user interface for applications
   and other commands.	Actions are defined in a database of files located
   along the database search path.

<dterm>action icon
   An icon representing a &ProductName; action in a File Manager or
	Application Manager
   window.  An action icon is displayed by creating an empty executable
   file and giving it the same name as the action it represents.

<dterm>action server
   A host computer that provides access to a collection of actions.

<dterm>application 
   See <term nogloss|software application|.

<dterm>Application Manager
	A window containing objects representing the system actions
	available on your system.


<dterm>application search path
  The search path used by the system to find applications and
  certain configuration information.  The application search path is
  set using two environment variables: DTAPPSEARCHPATH (per system) and
  DTUSERAPPSEARCHPATH (per user).

<dterm>application server
   A host computer that provides access to application software.
   Usually, the application server contains both the executable and
   the action definition for the application.


<dterm>application window
  See <term nogloss|window|.

<dterm>bitmap
  An image stored in a raster format.  Usually the term !!bitmap!!
  implies that the image is limited to exactly two colors (a foreground
  and a background color).  An image that uses more than two colors is
  usually called a !!pixmap!!.  

<dterm>bitmapped font
  A bitmapped font is made from a matrix of dots.  See <term nogloss|font|.

<dterm>button

	An action that directly executes a command.  The definition of
	a command action must include the EXEC-STRING field.


<dterm>command line prompt
   A command line prompt shows that the computer is ready to accept your
   commands.  Each terminal emulation window has a command line prompt
   that acts just like the command line prompt that would be shown if
   your computer was not running &ProductName;.  Usually the command line
   prompt is ``%'', ``>'', or ``$''.  You can find the command line
   prompt by pressing [[Return]] in a terminal emulation window.

<dterm>control
  A graphical user interface component that enables you to
  manipulate an object, select choices, or type information.  Menus,
  text fields, and Front Panel push buttons and indicators are examples of
  controls.

<dterm>current session
   A session that was saved when logging out of the previous session.
   Returning to the saved session allows you to continue working where you
   left off.  (Some applications may not participate in "session
   management," so you have have to manually start them after logging in.)

<dterm>data host
   A host computer where the data for an action is located.

<dterm>database host
   A host computer where an action is defined. Usually, this is the same
   host as the application server.  If the database host is not the
   same as the application server, the action definition must include
   the EXEC-HOST field to specify where the application is located.

<dterm>data types
   A &ProductName; mechanism used to associate particular data files with
   the appropriate applications and actions.  Data typing defines the
   criteria for typing the file (such as name or contents), the appearance
   (the icon used in File Manager) and the behavior of the object (for
   example, what happens when the user double-clicks it.


<dterm>Desktop
   A place to put files, directories, actions, and applications for quick
   access.  A Desktop is available in each &ProductName; workspace.  To put an
   object on the Desktop, drag its icon from a File Manager or Application Manager
   window and drop it on the workspace backdrop.  An object on the desktop
   operates just like its original icon.

<dterm>dialog

   Annotations do not alter the contents of the file or directory being
   annotated.  (Audio annotations are available only on systems capable of
   recording and playing audio.)


<dterm>File Manager
   A &ProductName; application for managing the files and directories on your
   system.


<dterm>file server
   A host computer used to store data files used by applications.

<dterm>filetype
   A &ProductName; mechanism used to associate particular data files with the
   appropriate applications and actions.  Filetypes can determine the type

   A file containing definitions for the Front Panel. The file must
   obey the naming convention ``%%name%%.fp'' and be in a directory
   on the search path defined by the environment variables
   DTUSERAPPSEARCHPATH and DTAPPSEARCHPATH.

<dterm>Help server
  A system in the network that provides online help data to other systems.
  If help files are kept with their applications, each application server
  is also a help server.  The system uses the DTHELPSEARCHPATH and
  DTUSERHELPSEARCHPATH environment variables to find help data files.
  (If these are not defined, the system uses DTAPPSEARCHPATH and
  DTUSERAPPSEARCHPATH.)

<dterm>home directory
  A personal directory where you keep files and additional subdirectories
  that belong to you.  By default, File Manager and Terminal Emulator
  windows are set to your home directory when you first open them.

<dterm>/%%HomeDirectory%%/
   Symbolizes your home directory.  For example, if your home directory is
   ``/users/anna/'', then ``/%%HomeDirectory%%/bitmaps/smile.bm'' represents
   ``/users/anna/bitmaps/smile.bm''.

<dterm>home session
   A session you explicitly save without logging out.

<dterm>hyperlink
   A connection from one help topic to another related topic.  A hyperlink
   can be a word, a phrase, or a graphic image.	 Any underlined text within
   a help window is a hyperlink.  

   Most hyperlinks cause a "jump" to a related help topic.  However,
   hyperlinks can also be used to perform other behavior, such as executing
   commands or invoking actions.  

<dterm>ITE

   An unseen character that marks the end of a line of text in a document.
   It tells a printer or screen to break a line and start a new one.

<dterm>object
   Any logical piece of data that has associated behavior.  For example, in
   File Manager, files, directories, actions, and applications are all
   considered objects.	Each type of object has specific associated
   actions.  Typically, each object is represented as an icon.

<dterm>object types
   A &ProductName; mechanism used to associate particular data files with
   the appropriate applications and actions.  Object typing defines the
   criteria for typing the file (such as name or contents), the appearance
   (the icon used in File Manager) and the behavior of the object (for
   example, what happens when the user double-clicks it.

<dterm>objects/actions database
	The database that defines the object types (file types) and actions
	known to the system.


<dterm>pixmap
