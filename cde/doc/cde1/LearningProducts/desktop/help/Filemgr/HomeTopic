Use File Manager to create, find, and use workspace objects: files,
folders, and applications.  Each object is represented by an
icon in File Manager.  File Manager enables you to do a number of
things with these objects.  For example, you can move, copy, open,
and delete them. You can also use File Manager to view the contents of your
floppy diskettes and CD-ROMs.
