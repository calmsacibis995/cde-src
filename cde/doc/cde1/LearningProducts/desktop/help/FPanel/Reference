<s1 id=TypesofControls>Deleting and Restoring Controls
	<idx|control:restoring|
	<idx|restoring Front Panel controls|

It may be difficult to restore certain types of deleted controls.
The level of difficulty depends on how the control was created, and on its
functionality.

Controls in the Front Panel can be created two ways:

<list bullet>
<item> By dragging an icon from File Manager or Application Manager to
  an Install Icon control. 

  These controls are easy to restore&emdash;simply
  repeat the installation procedure.

<item> By defining the control in a Front Panel configuration file
  (see the <book>Common Desktop Environment Advanced User's and
  System Administrator's Guide<\book>).
  The built-in controls and controls provided by your system
  adminstrator are defined this way.

  If you delete a control defined in a configuration file, it 
  may be more difficult to restore, since 
  there may not be an
  icon in File Manager or the Application Manager that you can 
  install. 
<\list>


<procedure>Example
Suppose you perform the following procedure:

<list order>
<item> Install an icon into the Home Folder subpanel.
<item> Copy the new control to the Main Panel.
<\list>

<p>This places the File Manager control in the subpanel, and makes
it possible to delete the control using its pop-up menu.
If you delete a control that you installed on the Front
Panel using the Install Icon control, see <xref ToRestoreFrontPanel>.

<p>If you delete a Front Panel control for which there is no icon in 
File Manager or Application Manager, see the <book>Common Desktop 
Environment Advanced User's and System Administrator's Guide<\book> 
for information on modifying Front Panel configuration files.

Before you log out, always save any open data files.
For example, you should save data from applications
that run in terminal windows, like a text editor file.

Data files and applications that do not create
their own windows cannot be saved automatically during logout.
Additionally, some non-desktop applications do not
save their internal state during logout and may need
to be restarted manually next time you login.

To change whether your current session is restarted
or your home session restored, click Style Manager's Startup
icon. 

Restarting your current session will bring back
this session exactly as it is right now.  Restoring
your home session will bring back the session you
previously saved as the session to which you want
to keep returning.  Save a home session by choosing
Set Home Session in Style Manager's Startup dialog box.
