<s1 id=OverviewOfCalendar>Introducing Calendar

The &ProductName Calendar uses the concept of <term nogloss>views<\term>
of your calendar.  The Calendar views are the:

<list bullet tight>
<item> Day
<item> Week
<item> Month
<item> Year
<\list>

displayed in the main Calendar window.  

<s1 id=CalViewNavigation>Navigation Between Calendar Views

Each Calendar view connects quickly to one or more other Calendar views
when you click on buttons or icons in the Tool bar such as Today, 
Previous view (left arrow), Next view (right arrow), Day view, Week view, 
Month view, or Year view.

Other methods of navigation between views are to click on day numbers
in Week or Month view, day numbers in the three-month panel in Day view,
and Month names in Year view.

<s1 id=CalApptEditor>The Appointment Editor

To add, delete, or change any appointments in your calendar, 
use Calendar's Appointment Editor.

<s1 id=CalGroupApptEditor>The Group Appointment Editor

To schedule a group meeting or notify a group of users about
a scheduled meeting, use the Compare Calendars dialog box and
the Group Appointment Editor.

<s1 id=CalBrowseCals>Browsing Other Users' Calendars

Besides maintaining appointments on your own calendar, you
can browse (look at) and sometimes edit other calendars.  To browse
other calendars, you need to know the <emph>calendar-name<\emph>
and <emph>hostname<\emph> where the calendar is located.  

To edit other calendars, you must first be given access by the 
calendar's owner.

<s1 id=CalFindUserID>Calendar Names

The &ProductName Calendar application uses the model that calendars
can be separate from users.  Calendars, besides the most common situation
of representing users, could also represent conference rooms, other
logically-grouped meetings, etc.
