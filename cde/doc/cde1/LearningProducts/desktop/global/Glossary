   and other commands.	Actions are defined in a database of configuration
   files.

<dterm>action icon
   Also called <term nogloss|application icon|.
   An icon in File Manager or Application Manager that represents an
   underlying action. Most desktop actions run commands.
   Double-clicking the action icon runs the action, which then runs the
   command.
   An action icon is created by creating an empty executable file with the 
   same name as the action it represents.

<dterm>Application Manager
   A window containing objects representing the system actions available 
   on your system.

<dterm>application search path
   The search path used by the system to find applications and

   search path to dynamically populate its top level when a user logs in. 
   The desktop search paths are created at login by the desktop utility 
   ``dtsearchpath''. The ``dtsearchpath'' utility uses a combination of 
   environment variables and built-in locations to create the search paths.

   Usually, the application server contains both the executable and
   the action definition for the application.

<dterm>base name
  The file name of an icon file minus the file-name suffixes for 
  size (``.l'', ``.m'', ``.s'', ``.t'') and type ``.pm'', ``.bm'').
