 * Each individual architecture may have more or less of the above.
 * Use EXTRA_DEFINES and EXTRA_INCLUDES to add defines and includes
 * to an individual architecture.  There is no equivalent for

 * USE_libraryname in LOCAL_LIBRARIES is by default empty.
 * It should be set when necessary to the real library macro name.

/* DEPLIBS contains the list of library depencies for a client.
 * LOCAL_LIBRARIES contains the list of libraries on the link line.
 * Generally, the dependency form of a library has DEP as a prefix.
 * e.g. put $(XLIB) in LOCAL_LIBRARIES and $(DEPXLIB) in DEPLIBS.
 * NOTE: if DEPLIBS is not set here, it is by default null and there
 *       are no library dependencies for clients.
 *       You cannot put -Llibpath into DEPLIBS. You must put actual
 *       paths to the library.
