this test directory contains subdirectories (one for each test)

  directory which starts with R - contains program to test some of the
                                  resources

  directory which starts with C - contains program to test some of the
                                  command line option

  directory which does not start  with C or R - 
                                  contains program to test some of the
                                  escape sequences

   You will find README in each subdirectory which gives information 
   about the test and if it refers to dtterm.object, you can find the
   file in data subdirectory.

   all resource tests (starts with R) expect a file named xrdb.out in
   the directory in which you tests. you can create that file by
   executing the command  xrdb -q > xrdb.out (it's basically the current
   resource setup)

   let me know if in case you need. my email add vels@hpcvlx.cv.hp.com
