For running the AppBuilder (ab), do the following:
--------------------------------------------------

1. setenv XAPPLRESDIR to
   <AB_WORK_SPACE>/cose/unity1/cde_app_builder/src/ab

2. (optional) setenv XENVIRONMENT to
   <AB_WORK_SPACE>/cose/unity1/cde_app_builder/src/ab/Ab
   Do this only if you plan to use the app-builder from
   another directory.

3. The executible is called ab.
