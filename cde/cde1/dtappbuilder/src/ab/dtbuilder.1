.\"--- NAME
.\"--- Give the name of the entry and briefly state its purpose.
.\"--- This section is used by cross-referencing programs.  Hence, do not
.\"--- use any font changes or troff escape sequences in this section.
.\"--- After the name, use one space, a backslash minus \(mi, and then another space
.\"--  before the summary.  
.\"--- Do not start the summary sentence with a capital letter or use
.\"--- any punctuation at the end.
.\"--- The summary line must be on one line (it can wrap). The reason for this
.\"--- is that some man page implementations build an index of man page values
.\"--- by reading through and getting the single line that follows the .SH NAME
.\"--- line.  The line doesn't have to fit on a terminal screen, but there
.\"--- can be only one physical new line on the line.

.\"--- DESCRIPTION
.\"--- This section describes the actions of the utility. If the utility
.\"--- has a very complex set of subcommands or its own procedural language,
.\"--- an EXTENDED DESCRIPTION heading is provided.  Most explanations of
.\"--- optional functionality are omitted here, as they are usually explained
.\"--- under the OPTIONS heading.
.\"--- When specific functions are cited, the underlying operating system
.\"--- provides equivalent functionality and all side effects associated 
.\"--- with successful execution of the function.  The treatment of erors and 
.\"--- intermediate results from the individual functions cited are generally
.\"--- not specified by this document.  See the utility's EXIT STATUS and
.\"--- CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS section for all actions associated with errors
.\"--- encountered with by the utility.
.\"---   
.\"--- When writing, use active voice, never use 2nd person, and make it 
.\"--- clear who or what the requirements are placed on.
.\"--- 
.\"--- DESCRIPTION example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- Do not say:  When you are done with this 
.\"--- implementation object, it should be freed. (Who frees
.\"--- it, the programmer or the implementation?) 
.\"--- Do use active voice and say:  When you are done with this implementation
.\"--- object, you must free it.  Or:  When you are done with this
.\"--- implementation object, the implementation will free it.
.\"--- 
.\"--- Make the utility the grammatical subject
.\"--- of the first sentence; use a present tense verb to describe the utility;
.\"--- note that whenever you use the utility name, use the
.\"--- .Fn request and put it on a single line.  
.\"--- .Fn gets the correct font and puts in the trailing  
.\"--- "( )" with the correct spacing.
.\"---  
.\"--- DESCRIPTION example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- The 
.\"--- .Fn tt_session
.\"--- utility is the ToolTalk message server. 
.\"---
.SH DESCRIPTION
The 
.BR dtbuilder 
utility is an interactive application development tool and user 
interface management system for \s-1CDE\s+1.
Known more fully as the \s-1CDE\s+1 Application Builder,
.BR dtbuilder 
is designed to make it easier for developers to construct applications that
integrate well into the Common Desktop Environment.
It provides two basic services - aid in assembling Motif objects into the
desired application user interface and generation of appropriate calls 
to the routines that support \s-1CDE\s+1 desktop services (e.g. ToolTalk, sessioning,
Help).
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- OPTIONS
.\"--- This section describes the utility options and option-arguments, and how
.\"--- they modify the actions of the utility.
.\"--- Default behavior:  When this section is listed as "None", it means that
.\"--- the implementation need not support any options.
.\"---
.\"--- OPTIONS example:
.\"---
.\"--- .SH OPTIONS
.\"--- need something here as an example
.\"--- 
.SH OPTIONS
None.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- OPERANDS
.\"--- This section describes the utility operands, and how they affect the
.\"--- actions of the utility. 
.\"--- Default behavior: When this section is listed as "None", it means that 
.\"--- the implementation need not support any operands.  
.\"--- 
.\"--- OPERANDS example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- .SH OPERANDS
.\"--- need some sort of example here
.\"--- 
.SH OPERANDS
The
.BR dtbuilder 
utility accepts an optional filename operand
that is interpreted as the name of an application project file
that should be loaded for editing.
This file should be in the BIL format defined for use by the
Application Builder.
.PP
If no project file is specified, then 
.BR dtbuilder 
comes up "empty", ready for a new
application to be developed interactively by the user.
.\"--- 
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- RESOURCES
.\"--- This section, which has no corresponding section in the X/Open CAE
.\"--- Specification, Commands and Utilities, Issue 4, lists the X Window 
.\"--- System resources that affect the utility operation.
.\"--- 
.\"--- RESOURCES example:
.\"---
.\"--- .SH RESOURCES
.\"--- need some sort of example here.
.\"--- 
.SH RESOURCES
None.
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- CAPABILITIES
.\"--- TBD
.\"--- 
.\"--- 
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- STDIN
.\"--- This section describes the standard input of the utility.  This section 
.\"--- is frequently a reference to the following section, as many utilties
.\"--- treat standard input and input files in the same manner.  Unless
.\"--- otherwise stated, all restrictions described under the INPUT FILES
.\"--- heading apply to this section as well.
.\"--- Default behavior: When this section is listed as "Not used", it means
.\"--- that the standard input will not be read when the utility is used as
.\"--- described by this document.
.\"--- 
.\"---STDIN example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- .SH STDIN
.\"--- need some example here 
.\"---
.SH STDIN
Not used.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "INPUT FILES"
.\"--- This section describes the files, other than the standard input, used
.\"--- as input by the utility.  It includes files named as operands
.\"--- and option-arguments as well as other files that are referred to, such
.\"--- as startup and initialization files, databases, etc.  Commonly-used
.\"--- files are generally described in one place and cross-referenced by other 
.\"--- utilities.
.\"--- Default Behavior:  When this section is listed as "None", it means that
.\"--- no input files are required to be supplied when the utility is used as d
.\"--- described om this document.
.\"--- 
.\"--- INPUT FILES example:
.\"---
.\"--- "INPUT FILES"
.\"--- need an example here
.\"--- 
.SH "INPUT FILES"
A project file to be processed by the
.BR dtbuilder 
utility must to be in the BIL format defined for the \s-1CDE\s+1 Application 
Builder.
.PP
Interactively, the Application Builder provides facilities for loading 
additional project files, as well as application module files
(which also must be in the BIL format) and interface files that use
Motif's UIL format.
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.\"--- This section lists what variables affect the utility's execution.
.\"--- Default Behavior:  When this section is listed as "None", it means that the
.\"--- behavior of the utility is not directly affected by environment variables
.\"--- described by this document when the utility is used as described in this 
.\"--- document.
.\"--- 
.\"--- ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES example:
.\"---
.\"--- .SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
.\"--- need example here
.\"--- 
.SH "ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES"
None.
.\"--- 
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
.\"--- This section lists how the utility reacts to such events as signals 
.\"--- and what signals are caught.
.\"--- 
.\"--- ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- .SH "ASYCHRONOUS EVENTS"
.\"--- The
.\"--- .Cm ttsession
.\"--- utility reacts to two signals.
.\"--- If it receives the
.\"--- .Cn SIGUSR1
.\"--- signal, it toggles trace mode on or off (see the
.\"--- .B \(mit
.\"--- option).
.\"--- If it receives the
.\"--- .Cn SIGUSR2
.\"--- signal, it rereads the types file.
.\"--- The
.\"---.Cm ttsession
.\"--- utility takes the standard action for all other signals.
.\"--- 
.SH "ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS"
The
.BR dtbuilder 
utility takes the standard action for all signals.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "STDOUT"
.\"--- This section describes the standard output of the utility.
.\"--- Default Behavior:  When this section is listed as "Not Used", it means 
.\"--- that the standard output will not be written when the utility is used as
.\"--- described in this document.
.\"--- 
.\"--- STDOUT example:
.\"---
.\"--- .SH STDOUT
.\"--- When the
.\"--- .B \(miv
.\"--- option is used,
.\"--- .Cm ttsession
.\"--- writes the version number in an unspecified format.
.\"--- When
.\"--- .B \(mip
.\"--- is used,
.\"--- .Cm ttsession
.\"--- writes the name of a new process tree session.
.\"--- 
.SH STDOUT
Not used.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- STDERR
.\"--- This section describes the standard error output of the utility.  
.\"--- Only those messages that are purposely sent by the utility are 
.\"--- described.
.\"--- Default Behavior:  When this section is listed as "Used only for dagnostic
.\"--- messages", it means that, unless otherwise stated, the diagnostic messages
.\"--- are sent to the standard error only when the exit status is non-zero
.\"--- and the utility is used as described by this document.
.\"--- When this section is listed as "Not used", it means that the standard 
.\"--- output will not be written when the utility is used as
.\"--- described in this document.
.\"--- 
.\"--- STDERR example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- .SH STDERR
.\"--- need example here
.\"--- 
.SH STDERR
Used only for diagnostic messages.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "OUTPUT FILES"
.\"--- This section describes the files created or modified by the utility.
.\"--- Default Behavior:  When this section is listed as "None", it means that no 
.\"--- files are created or modified as a consequence of direct action on the
.\"--- part of the utility when the utility is used as described by this 
.\"--- document.  However, the utility may create or modify system files, such
.\"--- as log files, that are outside the utility's normal execution environment.
.\"--- 
.\"---  OUTPUT FILES example:
.\"---
.\"--- .SH "OUTPUT FILES"
.\"--- need example 
.\"--- 
.SH "OUTPUT FILES"
None by default.
.PP
Interactively, the Application Builder provides facilities for writing
("saving") application project and module files, both of which must be 
in the BIL format, and also for writing ("exporting") interface files that use
Motif's UIL format.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
.\"--- This section provides a place for describing the actions of very complicated
.\"--- utilities, such as text editors or language processors, which typically
.\"--- have elaborate command languages.
.\"--- Default behavior: When this section is listed as "None", no further 
.\"--- description is necessary.
.\"---
.\"--- EXTENDED DESCRIPTION example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- .SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
.\"--- need example
.\"--- 
.SH "EXTENDED DESCRIPTION"
None.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "EXIT STATUS"
.\"--- This section describes the values the utility returns to the calling 
.\"--- program, or shell, and the conditions that cause these
.\"--- values to be returned.  Usually, utilities return zero for successful
.\"--- completion and values greater than zero for various error conditions.
.\"--- If specific numeric values are listed in this section, the system
.\"--- uses those values for the errors described.  In some cases, status
.\"--- values are listed more loosely, such as ">0".  A portable application 
.\"--- cannot rely on any specific value in the range shown and must be 
.\"--- prepared to receive any value in the range.  For example,
.\"--- a utility may list zero as a successful return, 1 as a failure for a 
.\"--- specific reason, and >1 as "an error occurred".  In this case,  
.\"--- unspecified conditions may cause a 2 or 3, or other value, to be 
.\"--- returned.  A portable application should be written
.\"--- so that it tests for successful exit status values (zero in this case),
.\"--- rather than relying on the single specific error value listed
.\"--- in this document. In that way, it will have maximum portability,
.\"--- even on implementations with extensions.  Unspecified error 
.\"--- conditions may be represented by specific values not listed
.\"--- in this document.
.\"---
.\"--- EXIT STATUS example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- .SH "EXIT STATUS"
.\"--- When the
.\"--- .B \(mic
.\"--- child process exits,
.\"--- .Cm ttsession
.\"--- exits with the status of the exited child.
.\"--- Otherwise, the following exit values are returned:
.\"--- .VL 4
.\"--- .LI 0
.\"--- Normal termination.
.\"--- Without the
.\"--- .B \(mic
.\"--- or
.\"--- .B \(miS
.\"--- options, a zero exit status means
.\"--- .Cm ttsession
.\"--- has successfully forked an instance of itself that has begun
.\"--- serving the session.
.\"--- .LI 1
.\"--- Abnormal termination.
.\"--- The
.\"--- .Cm ttsession
.\"--- utility was given invalid command line options, was interrupted by
.\"--- .Cn SIGINT ,
.\"--- or encountered some internal error.
.\"--- .LI 2
.\"--- Collision.
.\"--- Another
.\"--- .Cm ttsession
.\"--- was found to be serving the session already.
.\"--- .LE
.\"--- 
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The following exit values are returned:
.PP
.RS 3
.nr )J 4
.LI 0
Normal termination.
.LI 1
Abnormal termination.
The
.BR dtbuilder 
utility was unable to allocate necessary memory or spawn the code generator.
.PP
.RE
.nr )J 0
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
.\"--- This section describes the effects on the environment, files systems, and
.\"--- so on, when error conditions occur.  It does not describe error messages
.\"--- produced or exit status values used.
.\"--- When a utility encounters an error condition, several actions are possible,
.\"--- depending on the severity of the error and the state of the utility.  
.\"--- Included in the possible actions of various utilities are: deletion of
.\"--- temporary intermediate work files; deletion of incomplete files; validity
.\"--- checking of the file system or directory.
.\"--- Default behavior:  When this section is listed as "Default", it means that
.\"--- any changes to the environment are unspecified.
.\"--- 
.\"--- CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS example:
.\"--- 
.\"--- .SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
.\"--- need example here.
.\"--- 
.SH "CONSEQUENCES OF ERRORS"
Default.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- "APPLICATION USAGE"
.\"--- This section gives advice to the application programmer or user about the
.\"--- way the utility should be used.
.\"--- 
.SH "APPLICATION USAGE"
Because the
.BR dtbuilder 
is a complex, highly-interactive tool, users
typically consider the command line interface as little more than the way
to start up the Application Builder.
.PP
\s-1CDE\s+1 provides an "AppBuilder" action so the Application Builder can be
invoked through the standard action interface, including through
the Application Manager.
.\"---
.\"----------------------------------------------------------------------------
.\"--- EXAMPLES
.\"--- This section gives one or more examples of usage, where appropriate.
.\"--- 
.SH EXAMPLES
.TP
.B "dtbuilder"
This runs the \s-1CDE\s+1 Application Builder, presuming that the user will either
be creating a new project or will load one interactively through the
Application Builder's "File" menu.
.TP
.B "dtbuilder myproject.bip"
Starts the \s-1CDE\s+1 Application Builder and instructs it to load the project
defined in the file
.BR myproject.bip .
