120 "The Main Window is the starting point for building a graphical user interface.  The interface is created by dragging objects from the App Builder object palette, editing the properties of interface objects, and adjusting the layout of the interface."
121 "Use the Main Window's menu bar to access all of the command menus in App Builder, as well as its help menu."
122 "The mode bar includes buttons to control the operational mode of App Builder.  Build mode is used to construct or edit interfaces, and two different test modes allow testing of the interface and project being built."
123 "App Builder includes three object palettes: Windows, Panes and Controls.  Each contains objects that may be created for use in the interface being built."
124 "The Object Information area provides information about the object directly beneath the cursor, the cursor position, and the module being edited."
125 "The Panes palette contains four objects: control pane, text pane, draw area pane, and term pane.  Each may be used to create a single or layered pane in the interface.  The control pane may be used to hold other types of panes, or any of the items from the Controls palette."
126 "The Windows palette contains three objects: main window, custom dialog, and file selection dialog.  Each of these may be used to create a window-type object for use in the application."
127 "A Control Pane is used as the foundation upon which controls and other types of panes may be dropped and arranged.   "
128 "The Controls palette contains 14 objects, including buttons, lists, text fields and a menubar.  Each of these represents individual interface objects that may be created for use in the application interface."
129 "The Main Window object is used to create an application base window, and is the starting point for application interface development."
130 "A Custom Dialog is a window for displaying information or providing a pop-up for a specific task within an interface."
131 "A File Selection Dialog provides a standard way for accessing files within an application (e.g., Save, Open, etc.)"
132 "The Text Pane object provides a multi-line text-entry area, and may be a separate pane or created within a Control Pane."
133 "A draw area pane is used as a drawing or display area, and has optional scrolling capabilities so that a large display area may be examined through a smaller view area."
134 "A Term Pane provides terminal emulation functional as an object which may be embedded within an application interface."

143 "Opening a read-only project means that any changes\nthat affect the project (.bip) file, such as creation\nof a new module or creation of a cross-module connection,\ncannot be saved. You have the option of continuing\nwith reading in the project or cancelling the operation."
144 "Importing a read-only module means that any changes\nthat affect the module cannot be saved. You have\nthe option of continuing with the import or cancelling\nthe operation."
145 "The project that was opened does not reference\nany modules."
149 "Create as child of Group?"
151 "Changes, which have not been saved, have been\nmade to the currently loaded project. If you\nexit App Builder, those changes will be lost.\nYou have the option of continuing with the exit\noperation or cancelling it."
152 "A text, term, or draw pane can be created as a\nchild of a control pane, like a control object.\nPanes can also be layered, one on top of the\nother. You have the option of creating the pane\nas a child of the control pane, or as a layered\npane, or you can cancel the operation."
153 "Panes can be layered, one on top of the other.\nYou have the option of creating the pane as a\nlayer or cancelling the operation."
154 "The pane can be created as a layer, meaning it \nwill be stacked on top of the other pane, or it\ncan be created as a new pane in the paned window,\nin which case it will be placed at the bottom of \nthe paned window. You can cancel the operation \nif you do not want to do either."
155 "A text, term, or draw pane can be created as a\nchild of a control pane, like a control object.\nPanes can also be layered, one on top of the\nother. When dropped within a paned window, a\npane can also be created as another pane in a\npaned window. You have the option of creating\nthe pane in one of the three ways mentioned or\ncancelling the operation."
156 "Importing a module by copy means that a copy of\nthe module is read into App Builder. When it is\nsaved, it is saved to a new file. The original\nmodule file does not change, unless you overwrite\nit. Importing a module by reference means that\nany changes you make to the module will be reflected\nin the imported file when the module is saved. You \nhave the option of importing the module in either of\nthose ways, or you can cancel the operation."
157 "When App Builder receives a data buffer drop, such\nas a dtmail attachment, a temporary file is created\nthat contains that data. An error in creating that\ntemporary file occurred. The drag-and-drop operation\ncannot be completed.\n"
158 "This window is part of the interface you are \ncreating. If you want to remove the window from\nthe interface, delete it by selecting the window\n(in the footer area) and choose Delete from the\npopup menu (displayed by pressing mouse button 3\nin the interface).\n\nIf you want to hide the window, select its module\nin the Project Organizer and choose Hide from the\nModule menu. All windows in the module will be\nhidden."
159 "The object was dropped on a group in the control\npane.  You have the option of continuing with\ncreating the object as part of the group or\ncancelling the operation."
