Structure of UIL import/export code:

Import
------
proj.c:import_uil()
    top level fcn that reads in the uil file and displays the resulting tree
    if sucessful.

abuil_load.c:abuil_get_uil_file()
    called from import_uil(). This function parses a UIL file specified by
    uil_file_path using the standard callable UIL compiler and constructs a
    ABObj tree rooted at a AB_TYPE_MODULE after adding it to the supplied
    AB_TYPE_PROJECT, ab_project. Returns NULL in case of error; otherwise
    returns the AB_TYPE_MODULE object.

abuil_load.c:parse_uil()
    Use the callable UIL compiler to create a uil parse tree. Check all
    error conditionals and print a report on stdout. Returns the uil parse
    tree or NULL if there were errors.

    calls Uil()

    	For the call to Uil(), message_cb and status_cb handle stdout info
    	while the Uil compiler is running. user_mess_data is passed into
    	message_cb by the compiler and is used to indicate the number of
    	diagnostic messages output. user_stat_data is passed into status_cb
    	by the compiler and incremented to indicate the number of status
    	messages output.
