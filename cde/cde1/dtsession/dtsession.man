.SH NAME
\fBdtsession \(em The HP DT Session Manager.\fP
.sp 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dtsession
[options]
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDtsession\fP provides session management functionality during an HP DT
session, the time from login to logout.  It allows for saving a session, 
restoring a session, locking a session, and allocating colors for HP DT 
compatible clients.
.P
When a session is saved, client information, server settings, and
resources are retained.  Client information consists of
all clients currently active in the session.  Server settings consist of
settings (such as the beeper or keyboard) that are modified by a call to
the server.  Resources consist of all resources currently stored on the
\fBRESOURCE_MANAGER\fP property on the root window of the default screen.
.P
The session is locked by pressing the "lock" button on the workspace manager
(front panel).
When the display is locked, no further input is accepted until a correct
password is entered.  Correct passwords include the user who locked the
display, the root password for the system, and any users specified in
the \fBkeys\fP resource.
.P
Color allocation provides each client with a set of colors which are used
in creating visual components.  These colors can then be dynamically
changed by using the HP DT Style Manager (\fIdtstyle(1X)\fP).
.P
\fIDtsession\fP is automatically invoked by the HP DT Login Manager
(\fIdtlogin(1X)\fP).  If the
HP DT Login Manager is not currently being used, \fIdtsession\fP can
be invoked by putting the following command in an .xsession or .x11start
file:
.P
/usr/dt/bin/dtsession -norestore
.P
WARNING:  This command must be the first X11 client in the file (other
than xrdb).  It must be run in the foreground.  When using this command,
no save and restore functionality is available.  Any calls that start
up window managers must be removed from the startup file.  The default
window manager can only be changed by setting the \fBwmStartupCommand\fP 
resource.
.sp 1
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI \-norestore
This option allows users to use \fIdtsession\fP in a limited way.  The
advantage of using this option is that \fIdtsession\fP can be started
directly from an .x11start or .xsession script.  See use and warning above.
.SH CUSTOMIZATION
\fIDtsession's\fP behavior can be customized through the use of the HP DT 
Style Manager's startup dialog.  The following is the behavior that can be
customized.

.TP 8
.BR "Display Logout Confirmation"
"Display Logout Confirmation" allows you to toggle the appearance of the logout
confirmation box that appears after you click on the logout button
located in the workspace manager, or choose the "Log out..." option available in
the \fIdtwm\fP root menu.  Setting the button displays the logout dialog.
Clearing the button causes immediate exit with no
confirmation.  The default behavior is that the logout confirmation
dialog will be displayed.
.TP 8
.BR "Set Home Session"
The "Set Home Session" button allows you to save a home session for use
later.  The home session is a "snapshot" session that you can return to
by changing logout options.
.TP 8
.BR "Startup Behavior"
The startup behavior allows you to specify which state the HP DT Session
Manager will restore upon startup (login).  The default is that it
automatically restarts the state you were in at logout (Resume Current
Session).  The other
states available are "Return to Home Session" and "Ask Me at Logout."  "Return
to Home Session" returns you to the last saved home session at next
startup.  "Ask Me at Logout" allows you to choose which behavior you would
prefer at logout time.  If "Return to Home Session" is chosen, a home
session has to have been previously saved.  Otherwise the default system
session will appear at next login.  Note that "Ask Me at Logout" cannot be
active while "Display Logout Confirmation" is turned off.

.ps
.sp 1
.IP "\fBalarmTime\fP"
This resource specifies (in seconds) the amount of time before the lock
dialog is removed from the screen.  When the display is locked, the
pointer shows a lock cursor, and a dialog appears which asks for the
user password.  If no activity from the pointer or keyboard is detected
for \fBalarmTime\fP seconds, the dialog is removed from the screen.  The lock
dialog is redisplayed as soon as a pointer or keyboard event is
detected.  An
\fBalarmTime\fP of 0 leaves the lock dialog in place for the entire time the
display is locked.  The default value is 10 seconds.
.IP "\fBcolorUse\fP"
This resource specifies the number of colors to use for the user interface.
Valid types are:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
\fBB_W\fP \(em  Specifies a black and white system.  
The color palettes will use two color cells for the user interface.
In this configuration only two color palettes are available:
BlackWhite and WhiteBlack.
These palettes cannot dynamically change.  To change a palette,
all applications using that color palette must be restarted.
This resource value forces \fBShadowPixmaps\fP to True, and 
\fBForegroundColor\fP to either black or white depending on the palette chosen.
.IP \(bu 3
\fBLOW_COLOR\fP \(em Specifies a low color system.  
The color palettes will have two color sets and use a maximum of 12 color 
cells for the user interface, including black and white (color cells 0 and 1).
The number of color cells can be reduced by using the resources 
\fBShadowPixmaps\fP and \fBForegroundColor\fP.
.IP \(bu 3
\fBMEDIUM_COLOR\fP \(em Specifies a medium color system.  
The color palettes will have 4 color sets and use a maximum of 22 color cells
for the user interface, including black and white (color cells 0 and 1).
The number of color cells can be reduced by using the resources 
\fBShadowPixmaps\fP and \fBForegroundColor\fP.
.IP \(bu 3
\fBHIGH_COLOR\fP \(em Specifies a high color system.  
The color palettes will have 8 color sets and use a maximum of 42 color cells
for the user interface, including black and white (color cells 0 and 1).
The number of color cells can be reduced by using the resources 
\fBShadowPixmaps\fP
and \fBForegroundColor\fP.
The default value for this resource will be determined by querying
the X server for the number of color cells on the system.

.IP "\fBcoverScreen\fP"
This resource specifies whether or not the screens of the display will
be covered when the display is locked.  The default value is True,
which means that the screens will be covered.

.IP "\fBdynamicColor\fP"
This resource can have values of True or False.  \fBdynamicColor\fP is
used to reduce the number of color cells being used.  Once a palette has 
been selected and it is not likely to be changed,  \fBdynamicColor\fP can 
be set to False. 
If set to False colors cannot be dynamically changed using the DT
style manager. A selected
palette will take effect the next session.
The next time the session comes up, the color server uses Read Only
color cells that can be shared by all clients, thus reducing
the number of color cells used.

.IP "\fBforegroundColor\fP" 
This resource can have values of White, Black or Dynamic.
\fBForegroundColor\fP causes all text (foreground) to use either pixel 0 
or 1 (Black
or White) or to have a color cell dedicated to foreground and changes in
response to the background color (Dynamic) for each ColorSet.
If set to White or Black, the number of color cells used per ColorSet is
reduced by 1.
.IP "\fBkeys\ \ \ \ \      \fP"
This resource is a list of "keyholders" who have the ability to unlock
the screen any time it is locked by the user.  The list is a list of user
id's separated by commas.  For example if user kim has the following
resource active during a session:
.sp 1
\fBDtsession*keys: fred,keith\fP
.sp 1
Users fred and keith have the ability to unlock the display when kim
locks it.
.IP "\fBlockOnTimeout\fP"
This resource specifies whether or not dtsession will lock the screen
when there has been a period of time without pointer or keyboard activity.
The default value is False,
which means that the screen will not be locked automatically.  This 
resource only applies when using a server that has the ability to 
notify dtsession when the period of inactivity has occurred.
.IP "\fBqueryServerSettings\fP"
This resource specifies whether \fIdtsession\fP queries the server at
logout for all its settings or saves only those settings set by using
the HP DT Style Manager.  Querying the server ensures that all settings are
saved; however, there is a degradation in performance when a full query
is done.  The default value is False, which means that the server
will not be queried.
.IP "\fBshadowPixmaps\fP"
For color systems, this resource can have a value of True or False.
If True, \fBtopShadowColor\fP and \fBbottomShadowColor\fP use the same
pixel as background and \fBtopShadowPixmap\fP and 
\fBbottomShadowPixmap\fP are specified
instead of solid color to create the 3D look.
This reduces the number of color cells per ColorSet by 2.
\fBShadowPixmaps\fP defaults to True for systems with 4 or less color planes
(16 or less color cells),
and False for systems with more than 4 color planes.
.IP "\fBwmStartupCommand\fP"
This resource allows for an alternate window manager to be started at
login.  If this resource is NULL, dtsession starts /usr/dt/bin/dtwm.  An 
alternate startup might look like:
.sp 1
\fBDtsession*wmStartupCommand: /usr/bin/X11/mwm\fP
.sp 1
Note that the command should not have any commands to a shell in it, and
that it should not be surrounded by quotes.  Also, if any
other window manager other than \fIdtwm\fP is used, clients will be restored,
but may not be restored to the correct position.  By default, this resource
contains a NULL value.
.IP "\fBwriteXrdbColors\fP"
This resource should only be used if you are running non HP Motif 1.1 clients
that have color schemes that conflict with HP DT colors.  This has no
impact on clients linked with the Motif 1.1 library.  This resource
specifies whether color resource information should be written out.
If set to False, \fBbackground\fP and \fBforeground\fP resources will not
be written out with the values of the current palette.  This means that
non HP Motif 1.1 clients will not get HP DT colors when they are started.
The default value is True.
