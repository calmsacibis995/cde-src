#   This file contains a list of host names which are allowed or
#   denied XDMCP connection access to this machine.  When a remote
#   display (typically an X-termimal) requests login service, Dtlogin
#   will consult this file to determine if service should be granted
#   or denied.
#
#   Information regarding the format of entries in this file is
#   included at the end of the file.

#
#			   ENTRY FORMAT
#
#   An entry in this file is either a host name or a pattern.  A
#   pattern may contain one or more meta characters (`*' matches any
#   sequence of 0 or more characters, and `?'  matches any single
#   character) which are compared against the host name of the remote
#   device requesting service.
#
#   If the entry is a host name, all comparisons are done using
#   network addresses, so any name which converts to the correct
#   network address may be used.  For patterns, only canonical host
#   names are used in the comparison, so do not attempt to match
#   aliases.
#
#   Preceding either a host name or a pattern with a `!'  character
#   causes hosts which match that entry to be excluded.
#
#   When checking access for a particular display host, each entry is
#   scanned in turn and the first matching entry determines the
#   response.
#
#   Blank lines are ignored, `#' is treated as a comment delimiter
#   causing the rest of that line to be ignored,
#
#   ex.
#	!xtra.lcs.mit.edu  # disallow direct/broadcast service for xtra
#	bambi.ogi.edu      # allow access from this particular display
#	*.lcs.mit.edu      # allow access from any display in LCS
