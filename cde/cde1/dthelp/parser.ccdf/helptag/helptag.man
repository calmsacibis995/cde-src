.SH NAME
helptag \- Driver program to process
.B "HP Help System"
documents
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B helptag
.RI [ \|options\| ]
.I file
.RI [ \|parser\-options\| ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I helptag
is the driver program for the three phases of preparing an
.B "HP Help System"
document
for use in presenting online help.
These three phases
are parsing, creating a volume and keyword index and compressing the
resulting topic files.
.P
The
.I helptag
command accepts a single file name as an argument.  If the file name
contains a period ("."), any characters after the last period are
considered to be the extension.  The
.I helptag
command will remove all characters after the last period and use the
resulting name as the base name for all intermediate files and for the
final output files.  If the
.IR file
argument has no periods,
.I helptag
uses the argument as the base name for intermediate and output files
and assumes and extension of
.B .htg
for the input file.
.P
Several options
directing the
.I helptag
process may precede the file name.  Several arguments directing the
parsing phase of the
.I helptag
process may follow the file name.
.P
The output files are:
.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
.IR file ##.ht
\- where ## is replaced by 00, 01, etc., are the text of the help
topics.
.TP
\(bu
.IR file .hv
\- is an index into the
.B .ht
files for finding the beginning of topics.
.TP
\(bu
.IR file .hvk
\- is a list of keywords and their associated topics.
.TP
\(bu
.IR file .err
\- contains a log of the parsing activity along with any errors generated
during the parse.
.TP
\(bu
.IR file .xrh
\- is used in generating cross references.  This file is not used by the
runtime
.B "HP Help System"
engine.  It is used between passes of the parser phase
of the
.I helptag
process.  Retaining this file between invocations of
.I helptag
often eliminates the need for a second pass of the parser.
.RE
.SS Options
.br
.PP
The following options are recognized by
.I helptag
and must be placed before the
specified
.IR file.
.TP 10
.B \-clean
.br
The
.B \-clean
option removes all
.I helptag
generated files corresponding to the
.IR file
specified.
.TP
.B \-files
.br
This option emits a list of files entered as entity declarations in the
.IR file
argument.
.TP
.B \-help
.br
The
.B \-help
option prints a list of
.I helptag
options and their meanings to the standard output.
.TP
.B \-shortnames
.br
The
.B \-shortnames
option causes all generated file names to be less than
eight characters before the extension.  This length limitation is
achieved by truncating the input
.IR file
argument to six characters so that adding, for example, "00.ht" produces
an eight character file name and a two character extension.
.TP
.B \-verbose
.br
Setting the
.B \-verbose
option will cause
.I helptag
to be much more descriptive about the parser phase.
.SS "Parser Options"
.br
Any
.IR "parser options"
follow the
.IR file
argument on the command line and take the form
.B option=value
for those options taking a parameter and simply
.B option
for those options not taking a parameter.
Parser options may also be set in the environment variable TAGOPT, in a
.B helptag.opt
file or in a file named
.IR file .opt
in the current directory.
The
.B helptag.opt
file may reside in the current directory or in the directory in which
.I helptag
is placed.
.P
The order of precedence of the option settings is:
.RS
.TP 3
\(bu
The file
.B helptag.opt
in the helptag installation directory.  This
directory defaults to
.B /usr/vhelp/bin.
.TP
\(bu
The environment variable TAGOPT
.TP
\(bu
The file
.B helptag.opt
in the current directory.
.TP
\(bu
The file
.IR file .opt
in the current directory.
.TP
\(bu
The command line.
.RE
.P
Parser options set later in the list will override options set earlier.
.P
The parser options supported by
.I helptag
are:
.TP
.B onerror=go
.br
Cause errors to be non-fatal.  That is, parsing will continue and later
phases of the
.I helptag
process will be run even if syntax errors were encountered in the parse.
.TP
.B onerror=stop
.br
This is the default setting of the
.B onerror=
option.  It causes the
.I helptag
process to stop upon completion of the parser phase if syntax errors were
encountered during the parse.
.TP
.B charset=name
.br
The default character set used by the
.B "HP Help System"
is ISO8859-1.  A
different character set may be specified, e.g.,
.B name,
using the
.B charset=
option.  The character set may also be set in the
.B helplang.ent 
file described in the
.IR "HP Help System Developers' Guide".
.TP
.B search=path
.br
Adds
.B path
to the list of directories searched for file and image entities.
.TP
.B clearsearch
.br
Clears the list of directories searched for file and
image entities.
.TP
.B memo
.br
The
.B memo
option causes authors' memos to be included in the output document.
.TP
.B nomemo
Is the inverse of the
.B memo
option.  Both
.B memo
and
.B nomemo
may be specified but the last one mentioned will override
any previous setting.
.TP
.B shortfiles
.br
Neither the
.B shortfiles
.IR "parser-option"
nor any of its synonyms should be used.  Rather, the
.B \-shortfiles
option should be given as an
.IR option
to
.I helptag.
The
.I helptag
driver needs to know whether the user has requested short file names since
.I helptag
must know the names of the intermediate files.
.TP
.B shortfile
is a synonym for
.B shortfiles.
.TP
.B short
is a synonym for
.B shortfiles.
.TP
.B longfiles
.br
Neither this option nor any of its synonyms should be used for the same
reason that the
.B shortfiles
option should not be used.
.TP
.B " "
Long, untruncated, file names are the default.
.TP
.B longfile
is a synonym for
.B longfiles.
.TP
.B long
is a synonym for
.B longfiles.
.SH EXTERNAL INFLUENCES
.SS Environment Variables
.SM LANG
determines the language in which the input
.IR file
is interpreted.  The
.SM LANG
environment variable can be overridden in the
.B helplang.ent
file described in the
.IR "HP Help System Developers' Guide".
.PP
.SM TAGOPT
may be used to set parser options as described earlier.
.SS International Code Set Support
Single- and multi-byte character code sets are supported.
