17. The following messages and corresponding message sets are used only when
    specific error conditions are hit.  Their is no easy way for a localizer
    to display these messages, thus, their are no screen dumps or explanations
    on how to display them.  

    The bottom line is that they need to be localized, however, they cannot be
    viewed by the localizers.


  
    a) _DtMessage catalog set number: 2
       _DtMessage number(s): 29, 30, 33, and 38.
    

    b) _DtMessage catalog set number: 7
       _DtMessage number(s): 14, and 15.

   
    c) _DtMessage catalog set number: 8
       _DtMessage number(s): 3, and 4.
