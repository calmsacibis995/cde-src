The icons in this directory should be replaced with the ones we ship
with the HP COE run-time online help.  They are stored in:

        .../hp/rivers/help/graphicsShared/noteicon.pm
        .../hp/rivers/help/graphicsShared/cauticon.pm
        .../hp/rivers/help/graphicsShared/warnicon.pm

It was noticed that these files were out of synch too late to make it into
the IF3 release.
