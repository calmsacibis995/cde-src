The is the fourth point release for ksh-93. The RELEASEa
file contains a list of changes since the first release for ksh-93.
The file RELEASE lists the major changes since ksh-88.  I have updated
the man page, sh.1, and the introductory memo, sh.memo. I have also
started to write a guideline for adding runtime builtins, builtins.mm.
This release should correspond very closely to the information in the
New KornShell Command and Programming Language book, by Bolsky
and Korn.

This official release is being distributed and supported by the
Software Technology Center.  They are the distributor of
ksh93 within AT&T and will provide support.  I will only be
supplying ksh93 for research needs and for machine architectures
that are not supported by the Software Technology Center.
You can contact the STC by sending mail to ksh@mozart.att.com.

I have fixed most of the bugs that have been reported in
the previous release.  Let me know about any remaining bugs.

There continues to be very few reports of compatibility
problems.  The file COMPATIBILITY lists the known incompatibilities.
Please let me know about any script which runs under ksh-88 but
does not run under ksh-93.

Please look at the man page (troff -man) and the sh.memo
file (troff -mm) and let me know what problems you find.

I encourage you to run ksh -n script on each of your scripts
since the -n option produces warning messages for obsolete
features that you are using in the script.  The file
OBSOLETE, written by Kevin Wall, contains a list of
obsolete features.
