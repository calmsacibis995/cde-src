.SH NAME
bax \- tw + pax delta backup
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bax
.I file
.I base
[
.I "dir ..."
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I bax
generates backup tapes using
.I tw
and
.IR pax .
.I file
is the name of the backup archive to be generated.
If
.I base
is
.L \-
then a full backup is generated in
.IR file .
Otherwise
.I base
names a previous full backup against which a delta backup archive is
generated in 
.IR file .
The backup starts at the directories
.IR "dir ..." ,
.L /
by default.
File system boundaries are not crossed;  multiple file systems
must be specified as separate
.I dir
arguments.
.P
Variables defined in the shell script
.L ../lib/bax/init
located on
.L $PATH
customize the files and directories to be backed up.
The variables and their default values are:
.TP
\fBarch_name\f5='arch'\fR
.TP
\fBarch_keep\f5='bin|fun|lib'\fR
Shell patterns that match the architecture specific root directories and files.
The architecture specific files that match
\f5*/${\fIarch_name\f5}/*/${\fIarch_keep\f5}\fR are retained;
all other architecture specific files are skipped.
.TP
\fBbig_size\f5=5000000\fR
.TP
\fBbig_magic_keep\f5='mail'\fR
Files larger than \f5${\fIbig_size\f5}\fR must have a magic file type
that matches \f5${\fIbig_magic_keep\f5}\fR.
.TP
\fBname_skip\f5'?(*.)(old|save|tmp)?(.*)|.*-cache'\fR
File base names that match \f5${\fIname_skip\f5}\fR are skipped.
.TP
\fBpath_skip\f5='/dev|/usr/local/ast/ship'\fR
File path names that match \f5${\fIpath_skip\f5}\fR are skipped.
.TP
\fBreg_magic_skip\f5='core|cql * index|history|TeX dvi'\fR
Regular files with a magic file type that matches \f5${\fIreg_magic_skip\f5}\fR
are skipped.
.TP
\fBsrc_name\f5='src'\fR
.TP
\fBsrc_magic_skip\f5='executable|object|(archive|shared) library'\fR
Files under \f5*/${\fIsrc_name\f5}/*\fR with a magic file type that
matches \f5${\fIreg_magic_skip\f5}\fR are skipped.
.SH EXAMPLES
To generate a full backup on \f5/dev/st0\fP:
.EX
bax /dev/st0 -
.EE
To generate a delta backup in \f5/tmp/delta.bax\fP for the full backup above:
.EX
bax /tmp/delta.bax /dev/st0
.EE
or if you have two tape drives:
.EX
mt /dev/st1 eod # to append the next delta
bax /dev/st1 /dev/st0
.EE
