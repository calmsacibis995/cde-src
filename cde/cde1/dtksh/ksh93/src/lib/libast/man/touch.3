.SH NAME
touch \- set file access and modify times
.SH SYNOPSIS
.L "#include <ast.h>"
.sp
.L "int touch(const char* path, time_t atime, time_t mtime, int force);"
.SH DESCRIPTION
.L touch
sets the access and modify times of the file named by
.LR path .
If
.L "force != 0"
then the file is created if it doesn't exist;
otherwise the file is not created and
.L \-1
is returned.
If
.L "force < 0"
then
.L atime
and
.L mtime
are taken verbatim; otherwise
.L "(time_t)(-1)"
retains the current value for the file and
.L "(time_t)(0)"
uses the current time.
.SH CAVEAT
By default the change time is always changed to the current time.
