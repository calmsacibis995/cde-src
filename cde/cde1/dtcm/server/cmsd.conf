#
# Each configuration entry is composed of a single line of the form
# keyword value
#
# The keyword must start the line and the value follows the keyword,
# separated by white space.
#
# Two configuration options are supported.
#
# Trusted users option
# --------------------
# trusted value		Value specifies the list of users that are allowed
#			to create calendars on the local host.  Users are
#			separated by white space.  Each user is specified
#			in the format "user@host".  If the form "user",
#			is used, then the user from any host is allowed to
#			create calendars on the local host.  If the form
#			"@host" is used, then any user from the specified
#			host is allowed to create calendars on the local
#			host.  If an empty list is specified, no user
#			except the local super user is allowed to create
#			calendars on the local host.
#
# Untrusted users option
# ----------------------
# untrusted value	Value specifies the list of users that are not
#			allowed to create calendars on the local host.
#			The format is the same as the trusted users
#			option.
#
# These options are used to control who can and cannot create calendars
# on the local host.  If neither option is specified, rpc.cmsd allows
# any users from any hosts to create calendars on the local host.
# Otherwise, a user from a particular host is allowed to create calendars
# if a match is found in the trusted option or if the trusted user
# option is not specifed AND a match is not found in the untrusted
# option.  The local super user is always allowed to create calendars
# on the local host.
#
# Example:
#
# - an empty list specifies that no user can create calendars on the
#   local host
#
#	trusted
#
# - specifies that user1 from any host and user2 from host2 can create
#   calendars on the local host
#
#	trusted user1 user2@host2
#
# - specifies that any users except user1 from host1 can create calendars
#   on the local host
#
#	trusted @host1
#	untrusted user1@host1
#
# This file contains the default configuration, i.e., no options is
# specified and so any user from any host are allowed to create calendars
# on the local host.  To specify stricter control, copy this file
# to /etc/dt/config/cmsd.conf and edit that file.
#
# See the man page cmsd.conf(4M) for more information.
