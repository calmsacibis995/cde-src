Multi-Threaded Server Tests

These tests are designed to test the server API for MT-safety.
Only versions of the server that have been compiled with -DMT should be tested.
The test binaries can be run independantly or inside the MTtest script.

Setup:

There must be a user "nobody" with UID 60001.
For the register_test, there must be four more accounts:
	test1	1000
	test2	1001
	test3	1002
	test4	1003
The tests and MTtest script must be run as root.
