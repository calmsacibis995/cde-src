.SH NAME
\fBdtexec\fP \(em A "wrapper" program for command lines to 
control when the command exits. 
.sp 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dtexec <open_option> <command_line>
.nf
.in 10
.fi
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
Dtexec is used by the Common Desktop Environment (CDE) when
executing terminal-based actions.  Its'
purpose is to keep the terminal window
open after the command terminates in
the following circumstances:
.sp 1
.in 10
- If the action is of type PERM-TERMINAL.
.sp 1
.in 10
- If the action is of type TERMINAL and
the command "quickly" exits, which
indicates that an error occurred.
.P
The "open_option" arguments are:
.sp 1
.in 10
1. "-1" - Keep the window open when
"command_line" terminates.
.sp 1
2. "0" - Unmap the terminal window after
"command_line" terminates.
.sp 1
3. "n" - Keep the terminal window mapped if 
"command_line" terminates within "n" seconds of 
starting.  The default value is "3" seconds.  To
change the default, set the component's "waitTime"
or "WaitTime" resource.  For example, to change
the CDE File Manager to wait "5" seconds, 
set the following resource: "Dtfile*waitTime: 5".
Dtexec does not have any resources.
.P
Dtexec's default path is "/usr/dt/bin".  
To change this
location, set the component's "dtexecPath" or
"DtexecPath" resource.  For example, to change
the CDE File Manager's dtexec path to
"/usr/local/bin", set the following resource: 
"Dtfile*dtexecPath: /usr/local/bin".

.sp 1
.SH RETURN VALUE
\fBdtexec\fP returns 0 if successful; otherwise it returns 1.
Successful return from dtexec implies system resources were available
to fork and exec the requested command, not that the requested command
itself executed successfully.
.SH NOTES
.PP
This program is not normally invoked directly by application
programs.  Normally an application program will link with the
Desktop Services Library (DtSvc) which will then invoke \fBdtexec\fP
as needed.
.PP
As mentioned above, an application program can set its
\fIwaitTime\fP and \fIDtexecPath\fP resources to affect the behavior
of DtSvc library invocations of \fIdtexec\fP.
