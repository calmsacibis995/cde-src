Dtfile is composed of three different style toplevel windows (a directory
view, a toolbox view and a trashcan), along with a large selection of user 
dialogs and error dialogs.  Note that most dialogs have a help button, which 
when pressed, will cause the help window to appear, displaying the 
appropriate help information.

1) To display a dtfile directory view, select the file cabinet icon
   located in the top row of the front panel; a window similar to that
   shown in figure dtfile-1 will appear. Select one of the icons in this 
   directory, click mouse button 1 on a name of one of the files in this 
   dialog; a text widget for renaming will appear. Enter a new filename using
   a filename which already exists in this directory and press return; the 
   error dialog shown in figure dtfile-2 will appear.  Enter a path name
   such as "/tmp/tempfile" in the rename text widget and press return; the
   error dialog shown in figure dtfile-3 will appear.  Press mouse button 1
   any where in the file manager view to unpost the rename text edit widget.

   dtfile-4 will appear.  If you enter into this dialog the name of a

   widget you will get the error dialog shown in dtfile-9.  If you type the
   path "bogusname:/temp/file" into the copy as text widget you will get
   the error dialog shown in dtfile-10. While the "Copy" dialog is still
   up, rename the file you are copying in the File Manager view to some new
   name. Do this by click mouse button 1 on the text portion of the icon; a
   text label will appear; change the name and press return; the file will
   now be renamed.  In the "Copy" dialog put some new name in the text field
   such as "newfilename" and press "Ok"; the error dialog dtfile-11 will now

   with a file, select the icon for the file, post the 'File' menupane,

   will appear.  If you select the 'Group Name' field, and enter a non-existant
   group name such as "bogus", press "OK"; the error dialog shown in figure
   dtfile-13 will appear.  Change the group name back to a valid group name

   non-existant user name such as "bogus", press "OK"; the error dialog shown
   in figure dtfile-14 will appear.  Change the owner name back to what it was.
   If the selected icon file is a link to another file the dialog in figure
   dtfile-15 will appear. To get figure dtfile-15, open a second dtfile 
   view in another directory besides the users HOME dir.  Take a file from 
   the HOME dir and drag and drop it in the 2nd dtfile view while holding 
   down the "Shift" key.  Select that file and bring up the Properties dialog.
   By holding down the shift key you have created a link to the original file.
   Note that it is basically the same a dtfile-12 except it has link
   information in it.  Cancel out of the 'Properties' dialog.  Rename the
   original file you dragged and dropped to create the link to some other name.
   This will cause the linked file in the second dtfile dtfile view to
   change to a broken link. Double click on this broken link; the error 
   dialog shown in figure dtfile-16 will appear.
