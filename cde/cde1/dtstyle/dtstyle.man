acceleration or pointer movement threshold.
.IP "\fBAudio\fP"
Change the beeper volume, tone, or duration.
.IP "\fBScreen\fP"
Choose the number of minutes before your screen times out or
whether or not your screen is covered and locked at time out.
.IP "\fBWindow\fP"
Specify how a window aquires focus, if the window raises when it
receives focus, or where window icons are placed.
.IP "\fBStartup\fP"
Specify how your session begins and ends.

.TE
.sp 1
.IP "\fBcomponentList\fP"
Specifies the Style Manager components with a list of component keywords 
separated by spaces.  Valid component keywords include: 
Color, Font, Backdrop, Keybaord, Mouse, Audio, Screen, Dtwm, and Startup.
The default componentList value is: Color Font Backdrop Keyboard Mouse Audio 
Screen Dtwm Startup.
The componentList resource for a Dtlite session is: Color Backdrop
Font Dtwm.
.sp 1
.IP "\fBpaletteDirectories\fP"
Specifies a list of the directories (separated by spaces) where additional
color palettes are located.  
These palette files are used to generate the list of color 
palettes that a user may select from in the Color dialog.
In addition to this list palettes are also searched for in 
/usr/dt/palettes and $HOME/.dt/palettes.
.sp 1
.IP "\fBwriteXrdbImmediate\fP"
Controls when new font size or new mouse double-click time resources are
used.  If True, new resources are used when new clients start.  If False, 
new resources are used at the next session (after logout, with "Resume
Current Session" selected in the Startup dialog, and login).

.sp 1
.IP "\fBbackdropDirectory\fP"
Specifies the directory location for the backdrops listed
in the backdrop dialog.  This resource is also used
by dtwm.
.sp 1
.IP "\fBcolorUse\fP"
Specifies the number of colors to use for the user interface.
The default value for this resource is determined by querying
the X server for the number of color cells on the system.
Valid values are:
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
\fBB_W\fP \(em  Specifies a black and white system.  
The color palettes use only Black and Whte (color cells 0 and 1) and
icons are displayed as bitonal images.
In this configuration four color palettes are available:
Black, White, BlackWhite and WhiteBlack.
These palettes do not dynamically change.  To change a palette,
the HP Dt session must be restarted.
This resource value forces \fBshadowPixmaps\fP to True, and 
\fBforegroundColor\fP to either black or white depending on the palette 
chosen.
.IP \(bu 3
\fBLOW_COLOR\fP \(em Specifies a low color system.  
The color palettes use 2 color sets and icons are displayed as bitonal 
images.
The number of color cells can be further reduced by using the resources 
\fBshadowPixmaps\fP and \fBforegroundColor\fP.
.IP \(bu 3
\fBMEDIUM_COLOR\fP \(em Specifies a medium color system.  
The color palettes use 4 color sets and icons are displayed as bitonal 
images.
The number of color cells can be further reduced by using the resources 
\fBshadowPixmaps\fP and \fBforegroundColor\fP.
.IP \(bu 3
\fBHIGH_COLOR\fP \(em Specifies a high color system.  
The color palettes use 8 color sets and icons are displayed as 
multi-color images.
The number of color cells can be reduced by using the resources 
\fBshadowPixmaps\fP and \fBforegroundColor\fP.

.IP "\fBdynamicColor\fP"
This resource can have values of True or False.  \fBdynamicColor\fP is
used to reduce the number of color cells being used.  Once a palette has
been selected and it is not likely to be changed,  \fBdynamicColor\fP can
be set to False.
If set to False colors cannot be dynamically changed using the DT
style manager. A selected
palette will take effect the next session.
The next time the session comes up, the color server uses Read Only
color cells that can be shared by all clients, thus reducing
the number of color cells used.

.IP "\fBforegroundColor\fP"
This resource can have values of White, Black or Dynamic.
\fBforegroundColor\fP causes all text (foreground) to use either pixel 0 
or 1 (Black
or White) or to have a color cell dedicated to foreground that changes in
response to the background color (Dynamic) for each ColorSet.
If set to White or Black, the number of color cells used per ColorSet is
reduced by 1.
.IP "\fBshadowPixmaps\fP"
For color systems, this resource can have a value of True or False.
If True, \fBtopShadowColor\fP and \fBbottomShadowColor\fP use the same
pixel as background and \fBtopShadowPixmap\fP and 
\fBbottomShadowPixmap\fP are specified
instead of solid color to create the 3D look.
This reduces the number of color cells per ColorSet by 2.
\fBshadowPixmaps\fP defaults to True for systems with 4 or less color planes
(16 or less color cells),
and False for systems with more than 4 color planes.
.IP "\fBwriteXrdbColors\fP"
This resource should only be used if you are running non HP Motif 1.1 clients
that have color schemes that conflict with HP DT colors.  This has no
impact on clients linked with the Motif 1.1 library.  This resource
specifies whether color resource information should be written out.
If set to False, \fBbackground\fP and \fBforeground\fP resources are not
written out with the values of the current palette.  This means that
non HP Motif 1.1 clients do not get HP DT colors when they are started.
The default value is True.

.IP "\fBprimaryColorSetId\fP"
This resource specifies the primary color for an application.
The primary color is used for the main background areas of the application
and all children of the main area.
The value of this resource is a number from one to eight that represents
a specific color set in a palette.
.IP "\fBsecondaryColorSetId\fP"
This resource specifies the secondary color for an application.
The secondary color is used for the menubar and all menus and dialogs
of the application.
This allows dialogs on the screen to be visually associated with its parent
application by matching the dialog color to the menubar.
The value of this resource is a number from one to eight that represents
a specific color set in a palette.
