.SH NAME
\fBdthello - startup transition program for HP DT\fP
.P
\fBdtcolor - transition program and color server for HP DT Lite\fP
.sp 1
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dthello
[options]
.br
.B dtcolor
[options]
.PP  
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIDthello\fP is a client that provides a transitory visual during 
the startup of the Hewlett-Packard Visual User Environment (HP DT). 
\fIDthello\fP is designed to cover the interval between login 
(see \fBdtlogin(1)\fP) and the start up of the window manager 
(see \fBdtwm(1)\fP).
.PP  
\fIDthello\fP covers the screen with a window and displays a boxed
message.
The message consists of two parts: The first
part is a short welcome string.  This string may contain literal
and new-line characters. The second
part is the content of one or more (up to five) files. 
Each line of text from these two parts is left-justified 
against the boxed outline.
.PP  
\fIDtcolor\fP is used in HP DT Lite in place of \fIdthello\fR.
\fIDtcolor\fR offers the same
command line options, resources,
and behavior \fIexcept\fR that after
initialization, the \fIdtcolor\fR process puts itself in the
background and continues running for the duration of the HP DT Lite
session as a color server.  In HP DT Regular, the color server code 
is built into the session manager
(\fIdtsession\fP), so that the \fIdtcolor\fR
daemon needs to run only in HP DT Lite sessions.  
Because \fIdtcolor\fR offers a strict superset of \fIdthello\fR
functionality,
all comments about \fIdthello\fR apply equally to \fIdtcolor\fR.
.PP  
The default font for \fIdthello\fR
is chosen in a device-dependent way, depending
on the screen resolution of the display, whether high resolution
(\fIe.g.\fR, 1280x1024), medium resolution (\fIe.g.\fR, 1024x768), or
low resolution (\fIe.g.\fR, 640x480).
.PP  
\fIDthello\fP will display only a ``reasonable'' number of lines of
text. It
does not scroll or try to prevent the text from getting clipped if the
text does not fit on the screen.  If the line length is too long,
then \fIdthello\fR will not draw the encompassing box, and
will instead
align the text flush against the left edge of the screen.
.PP  
\fIDthello\fP is designed to be invoked just after login. The 
script file
that contains the default invocation of \fIdthello\fR is 
\fI/usr/dt/config/Xsession\fR.
.PP  
.SH OPTIONS
.TP 8
.BI \-display " display_name"
This option names the display on which to run.
The default display is taken from the DISPLAY environment variable.
.TP 8
.BI \-bground " background_color"
This option specifies the background color of the window.
The default value is "black" for B&W and screens with limited color
(16 or less) and "cornflowerblue" for screens with more 
colors (more than 16). 
The background color can also be specified by
setting the \fBvbackground\fR (class \fBVbackground\fR) resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-fground " foreground_color"
This option specifies the foreground color (for the text).
The default value is "white."
The foreground color can also be specified by
setting the \fBvforeground\fR (class \fBVforeground\fR) resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-file " file_name"
This option specifies a file from which to read message text. This option may
appear up to five times to include text from five different
files.  
If no file option is specified (the
default), the file \fI/etc/copyright\fR is displayed.
The \fBfile\fR (class \fBFile\fR) resource is recognized, but only one file
can be specified this way.
.TP 8
.BI \-font " font_name"
This option specifies the font to use with which to render the text string.
The default values are \fIsystem23\fR for high resolution displays,
\fIsystem19\fR for medium resolution displays, and \fIsystem16\fR
for low resolution displays.
The equivalent resource is \fBvfont\fR (class \fBVfont\fR).
.TP 8
.BI \-string " text_string"
This option specifies the message text to display.
Messages with embedded spaces must be quoted. Literal
new-line characters can be embedded in the text string to specify line
breaks. Each line will be left-justified on the screen.
The default text is:
.sp
Starting the
.br
Common Desktop Environment
.sp
The message text can also be specified with the \fBstring\fR (class
\fBString\fR) resource.
.TP 8
.BI \-timeout " num_seconds"
This option specifies the timeout value in seconds.
\fIDthello\fP sets a timer and then waits for the \fBReparentNotify\fP event
that signals that the window manager is up. If the timer expires,
\fIdthello\fP stops waiting on the window manager and terminates
immediately. The default value is 240 seconds. The equivalent resource
is \fBtimeout\fR (class \fBTimeout\fR).
.PP  
.SH ENVIRONMENT
\fIDthello\fP uses the DISPLAY environment variable.
.PP  
.SH WARNINGS
Lines that contain non-printable characters (such as the
tab character) may not display as expected.
