# Most common make targets.  All these are recursive over all appropriate
# directories.
#
# make		- same as make all
# make all	- make and install a complete debug (-g) version
# make product  - make and install a complete production (-O) version.
# make bb	- make (but do not install) a debug (-g) version of the "backbone"
#		  (libtt.so.1 and ttsession)
# make clean	- remove derived files
# make sccs-clean - remove sccs work files, force sccs gets

# Less common make targets, for specific purposes

# make tcov	- test coverage
# make lprof	- line by line profiling (does not work on libtt)
# make gprof	- call graph profiling

# Less common make targets, useful for quick partial builds when you know
# what you want. <VAR> is a variant key, one of:
# g		- debug variant
# O		- optimized variant
# tcov		- tcov variant
# gp		- gprof variant
# lprof		- lprof variant

# make proto-<VAR>	- make libraries, prep for building binaries
# make bin-<VAR>	- make binaries, assumes proper make proto-<VAR> done
# make install-<VAR>	- install already built binaries and libraries

# always make ttinstall.  I can't figure out how to do this only 
# when doing actual makes since the "here" targets get done after the
# recursive targets, so adding ttinstall to HEADER_DEPENDENCIES gets
# ttinstall done too late.
