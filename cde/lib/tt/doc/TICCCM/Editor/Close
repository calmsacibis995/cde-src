.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Release a reference to a buffer or view, optionally returning
the contents of the document.  After the last reference to
a buffer or view is released, the buffer or view is destroyed.  (The
.I shareLevel
parameter of the
.B Open
request allows for the creation of multiple references to the same
buffer or view.)
.PP
If the buffer or view is being destroyed, then before replying the
handler should unregister any patterns it had registered for handling
operations on the buffer (e.g., 
.BR Seek ,
.BR Goto ,
.BR Copy ,
.BR Paste ,
.BR Close )
or view (e.g.,
.BR Set_View ,
.BR Seek ,
.BR Goto ,
.BR Close ).
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.PP
.HP 5
.PD 0
\f(CWbufferID\fR \fIdocBuf\fR
.TP
\f(CWviewID\fR \fIdocView\fR
.PD
The ID of the buffer or view to which a reference is being released.
.TP
\f(CWboolean\fR \fIinquisitive\fR
Boolean value indicating whether the handler is allowed to
block on user input while carrying out the request.  (If true, the
handler is nevertheless not required to seek such input.)
.TP
\f(CWboolean\fR \fIforce\fR
Boolean value indicating whether the handler should
close the buffer or view even if circumstances
are such that the tool ordinarily would not do so.
.IP
For example, a tool might have a policy of not closing with
unsaved changes unless the user has been asked whether the
changes should be saved.  When
.I force
is true, such a tool should close even when doing so would lose
changes that the user has not been asked about saving.
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.so ../Media/.contents
.SH ERRORS
.TP
\f(BITT_ERR_NOMATCH\fR
No editor has a pattern handling the
.BR Close ()
request for
.I docBuf
.RI ( docView ),
and so it may not be a valid \f(CWbufferID\fR (\f(CWviewID\fR).
.TP
\f(BITT_DESKTOP_CANCELED\fR
.I force
was false, and the user (or the tool) decided to cancel the
operation.
.TP
\f(BITT_MEDIA_ERR_FORMAT\fR
The document in
.I docBuf
(or
.IR docView )
is of a media type other than
.IR mediaType .
.TP
\f(BITT_DESKTOP_ENODATA\fR
The \fIcontents\fR argument is being returned with no value
(and the file attribute of the reply is not set) because the
document in
.I docBuf
(or
.IR docView )
was empty.  When this condition occurs, the handler should not
fail the
.BR Close ()
request.
