.TP
\f(CWmessageID\fR \fIcounterfoil\fR
Unique string created by the message sender (typically by
concatenating a procid and a counter) to give both sender
and reciever a way to refer to this request in other
correspondence.  This argument should be included if the
sender anticipates a need to communicate with the handler
about this request before it is completed, e.g., to cancel
it.
.IP
When this argument is included, and the handler determines
that an immediate reply is not possible, then the handler
should immediately send at least one \f(CWStatus()\fR notice
point-to-point back to the requestor, so as to identify
itself to the requestor.
