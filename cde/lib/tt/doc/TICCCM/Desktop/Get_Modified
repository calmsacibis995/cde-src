.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Asks whether any tool has modified a volatile,
non-shared (e.g., in-memory) representation of the persistent
state of an entity (such as a file) with the intention of
eventually making that representation persistent.
.PP
Thus, a tool should register a dynamic pattern for this request
when it has modified an entity of possible shared interest.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I type ID
The identity of the persistent entity being asked about.
.IP
When
.I type
is \f(CWFile\fR, then this argument is unset (i.e., has a
value of \f(CW(char *)0\fR), and it refers to the file or directory
named in the message's file attribute.
.TP
\f(CWboolean\fR \fImodified\fR
Boolean value indicating whether a volatile, non-shared
(e.g., in-memory) representation of the entity has been
modified with the intention of eventually making that
representation persistent.
.SH ERRORS
.TP
\f(BITT_ERR_NO_MATCH\fR

not to be modified.
