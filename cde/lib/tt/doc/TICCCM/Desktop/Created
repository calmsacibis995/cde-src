.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The sender has created or deleted one or more entities that
may be of interest to other clients.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I type ID
The identity of the created entity.  If more than one entity
are created in the same logical event, extra \f(CWID\fR args may be
present.
.IP
When
.I type
is \f(CWFile\fR, each non-empty \f(CWID\fR argument is the name
of an entry which has been created in the directory named in
the message's file attribute.  (Thus, each argument is a single,
final component of a pathname.)
.IP
When
.I type
of the zeroth argument is \f(CWFile\fR and the argument is unset (i.e., has a
value of \f(CW(char *)0\fR), then it refers to the file or directory
named in the message's file attribute.
