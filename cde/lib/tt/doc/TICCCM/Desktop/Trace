of the reply is set to one of the following:

.SM TT_ERR_NO_MATCH
No handler could be found for the request.  This probably means
that the session is being managed by an instance of

that is older than version 1.2.

.TP
.SM TT_DESKTOP_ENOSPC

To trace to a different file, first turn off tracing to the
current trace file.
