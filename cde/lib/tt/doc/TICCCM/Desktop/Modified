.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\f(CWModified()\fR is sent whenever a tool first modifies a volatile,
non-shared (e.g., in-memory) representation of the persistent
state of an entity (such as a file), with the intention of
eventually making that representation persistent.  \f(CWReverted()\fR is
sent when all the modifications to such a representation have
been discarded.
