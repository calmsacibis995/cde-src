.SH EXAMPLES
.LP
This request is especially useful for when the user performs
an intermediate save of her modifications to a document
that is the subject of an
.BR Edit ()
or
.BR Display ()
request in progress.  (In the latter case, the
.BR Deposit ()
may be failed with
.SM TT_DESKTOP_EACCES
if the handler does
not choose to allow updates to the document being displayed.)
.\".LP
.\"The second variant of this request can be issued by editors that
.\"allow the user to create, as an afterthought, extra documents
.\""near" the document that was just edited.  This can be useful if
.\"the each document in the series can serve as the template or
.\"starting point for the next document.  Of course, if the handling
.\"container application does not support the notion of accomodating
.\"uninvited documents, it should reject the request.
