.SH NAME

Abstract - return a summary of a document in the suggested media type
.SH SYNOPSIS
.so ../.synopsis
[\fIfile\f(CW]	Abstract(	in	\fImediaType	contents\f(CW,	
		out	\fImediaType	output\f(CW,	
		in	boolean	\fIinquisitive\f(CW,	
		in	boolean	\fIcovert\f(CW	
		[in	messageID	\fIcounterfoil\f(CW]	
		[inout	vector	\fIsize\f(CW] );

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
From the given document, abstract a summary representation (for
example, an icon for an image, or a representative video frame for a
movie).  The abstraction should be the best possible representation of
the document given the requester's size constraints.
.SH REQUIRED ARGUMENTS
.so .contents
.TP
.I mediaType output
The abstraction of the document.
.so .inquisitive
.SH OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS
.so ../.counterfoil
.TP
\f(CWvector\fR \fIsize\fR
In the request, the maximum size of the abstraction.  The
recipient should return an abstraction as close to this size
as possible, without exceeding this size.
.IP
In the reply, the actual size of the abstraction being
returned; or, if \f(BITT_MEDIA_ERR_SIZE\fR, the smallest possible size
the recipient is capable of returning for this document.
.SH EXAMPLES
.PP
If Acme Inc.'s video tool is able to rasterize \f(CWJPEG_Movie\fR frames
(and somehow select a representative frame to rasterize), then it
could support a request of the form
.so ../.synopsis
	Abstract(	in	JPEG_Movie	\fImovie\(CW,	
		out	Sun_Raster	\fIframe\f(CW, ... );
.ft
.fi
.LP
Meanwhile, a desktop binding service might support a request of
the form
.so ../.synopsis
	Abstract(	in	JPEG_Movie	\fImovief\(CW,	
		out	XPM	\fIicon\f(CW, ... );
.ft
.fi
.LP
Then, when container applications acquire a snippet of Acme_Video
data, they could chose between a (presumably custom) raster and a
(presumably generic) XPM icon to represent the snippet, without
having to understand the \f(CWJPEG_Movie\fR format.
.SH ERRORS
.so .errors
.TP
\f(BITT_MEDIA_ERR_SIZE\fP
The requested size was too small.
.SH NOTES
.PP
It is possible to extract from the ToolTalk types database a list
of the installed
.BR Abstract ()
mediaType-to-mediaType mappings.
