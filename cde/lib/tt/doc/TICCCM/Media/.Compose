NAME
     Compose - compose a document

SYNOPSIS
         session Compose(    out <mediaType> contents
			  /* in  messageID   msgID,
			     in  string      title,
                             in  string      template   */ );
         file    Compose(    out <mediaType> contents
			  /* in  messageID   msgID,
			     in  string      title,
                             in  string      template   */ );

REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

     <mediaType> contents

          The contents of the document.  If the message is
          file-scoped, the contents argument shall have no value, and
          the document shall be contained in the scoped-to file.  The
          data type of the contents argument shall be string, unless
          nulls are legal in the given mediaType, in which case case
          the data type shall be bytes.

OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

     messageID msgID

          Unique string created by the message sender, typically by
          concatenating a procID and a counter.  This argument should
          be included if the sender anticipates a need to communicate
          with the handler about this request before it is completed,
          e.g., to cancel it.

     string title
          
          The name of the document, suitable for e.g. displaying in a
          window titlebar.  If the title argument is absent and the
          message is file-scoped, the scoped-to pathname may be
          considered the title of the document.

     string template
          
          Comma-separated list of pathnames of template file(s) to
          master from.

DESCRIPTION
     Compose a document, and reply with the contents when the
     composition is completed.
