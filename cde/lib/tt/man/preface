.UH H "\s-1Who Should Use This Book\s0"
.LP
This manual is for developers who create or maintain applications that use the ToolTalk 
service to inter-operate with other applications. This manual assumes familiarity with 
Solaris operating system commands, system administrator commands, and system terminology.
.UH H "\s-1How This Book Is Organized\s0"

.UH H "\s-1Formats Used to Describe Commands and Functions\s0"
.LP
This section describes the generic format used to present
the man pages in this manual. The man pages described in this
manual generally follow this format order, but, within any
give man page description, include only needed headings. For
example, if there are no bugs to report, there is no BUGS section. 
.LP
.UH H "\s-2          Name\s0"
.LP
This section gives the names of the commands or functions
documented, followed by a brief description of what they do.
.LP
.UH H "\s-2          Synopsis\s0"
This section shows the syntax of commands or functions.
When a command or file does not exist in the standard path,
its full pathname is shown.
Literal characters (commands and options)
are in 
.B bold 
font and variables
(arguments, parameters and substitution characters) are in
.I "italic"
font.
Options and arguments are alphabetized, with single letter
arguments first, and options with arguments next, unless a different
argument order is required.
.br
.ne 5
.LP
The following special characters are used in this section:
.RS
.IP [\|] 5
The option or argument enclosed in these brackets is optional.
If the brackets are omitted, the argument 
.I must
be specified.
.br
.ne 8
.IP .\|.\|. 5
Ellipses.  
Several values may be provided for the previous argument, or
the previous argument can be specified multiple times,
for example,
.RI ` "filename .\|.\|." '.
.IP \(or 5
Separator.
Only one of the arguments separated by this character can be
specified at time.
.IP {\|} 5
Braces.
The options and/or arguments enclosed within braces are interdependent,
such that everything enclosed must be treated as a unit.

.UH H "\s-2          Description\s0"
.LP
This section defines the functionality and behavior of the service.
Thus it describes concisely what the command does.
It does not discuss 
\s-1OPTIONS \s0
or cite 
\s-1EXAMPLES\s0.
Interactive commands, subcommands, requests, macros,
functions and such, are described under 
\s-1USAGE\s0.
.UH H "\s-2          Options\s0"
.LP
This lists the command options with a concise summary
of what each option does.
The options are listed literally and in the order they appear in the 
\s-1Synopsis\s0 
section.
Possible arguments to options are discussed under the option,
and where appropriate,
default values are supplied.
.UH H "\s-2          Return Values\s0"
.LP
If the man page documents functions that return values,
this section lists these values and describes the
conditions under which they are returned.
If a function can return only constant values, such as 0
or \-1, these values are listed in tagged paragraphs.
Otherwise, a single paragraph describes the return values
of each function.
Functions declared as
.B void
do not return values, so they are not discussed in
\s-1Return Values\s0.
.UH H "\s-2          Errors\s0"
.LP
On failure, most functions place an error code in the global
variable
.B errno
indicating why they failed.
This section lists alphabetically all error codes a function
can generate and describes the conditions that cause each error.
When more than one condition can cause the same error, each
condition is described in a separate paragraph under the error
code.
.UH H "\s-2          Usage\s0"
.LP
This section is provided as a
.I guidance
on use.
This section lists special rules,
features and commands that require in-depth explanations.
The subsections 
listed below are used to explain built-in functionality:

.UH H "\s-2         Examples\s0"
.LP
This section provides examples of usage or of how to use a
command or function.
Wherever possible a complete example including 
command line entry and machine response is shown.
Whenever an example is given, the prompt is shown as
.IP
.B example% 
.LP
or if the user must be super-user,
.IP
.BR example#
.LP
Examples are followed by explanations,
variable substitution rules, or returned values.
Most examples illustrate concepts from the
\s-1Synopsis\s0,
\s-1Description\s0,
\s-1Options\s0 
and 
\s-1Usage\s0 
sections.  
.UH H "\s-2           Environment\s0"
.LP
This section lists any environment variables that the
command or function affects, followed by a brief description
of the effect.
.UH H "\s-2          Files\s0"

files of interest, and files created or required by commands.
Each is followed by a descriptive summary or explanation.
