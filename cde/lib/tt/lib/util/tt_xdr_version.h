/* 
 * XDR/RPC versioning scheme
 * 
 * For client/server applications using rpc, there are two general
 * approaches to versioning. The first approach which is potentially
 * cleaner if useable is to have different servers for each version of
 * the protocol they support.  Clients will contact the version of server
 * they know how to talk and everything works. The second approach is to
 * have a single server that registers itself under as many versions as
 * it supports. This multi-version server then deals with rpc requests
 * from clients registering under different versions by using the rq_vers
 * field in the svc_req structure that the rpc system hands the handler
 * routine. Note that both version schemes assume that the version of rpc
 * and xdr are the same. In other words, if different xdr formats are
 * desired then those should be part of the rpc protocol version. For
 * tooltalk there is the complication that whenever information has to be
 * written out to a database version 1 xdr formats must be used. In other
 * words, tooltalk needs to distinguish between the version of an rpc
 * client making a request and the version it is using for xdr when
 * writing out information.
 * 
 * For this reason there is a slightly different version scheme in use.
 * There is a version field in the _Tt_global object _tt_global (see
 * tt_global_env.cc). This version field is shared by both the rpc versioning
 * and xdr versioning. The way it is set is by using the special
 * _Tt_xdr_version object. The constructor for this object takes an
 * integer argument which is the version number to set the default to.
 * The destructor for the object resets the global version number to the
 * desired default (version 2 for 1.0.1). Thus if a method needs to use
 * version 1 xdr formats to write something out to a database it does the
 * following:
 * 
 *                  method_using_version_1()
 * 		 {
 * 			_Tt_xdr_version		xvers(1);
 * 
 * 				... body of method ...
 * 
 * 		 } // destructor for xvers will reset the
 * 		   // version number appropiately
 * 
 * This same mechanism is used for rpc requests. where the
 * _tt_service_rpc dispatch routine (see tt/lib/mp/mp_rpc_implement.cc)
 * sets the global version to the rq_vers field handed to us by the rpc
 * system. In this fashion the needs of both xdr and rpc versioning are
 * taken care of.
