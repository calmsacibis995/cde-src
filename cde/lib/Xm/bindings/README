This directory contains Motif virtual bindings files.

The file xmbind.alias maps an X server vendor name, and optional vendor
release number, to a file containing the virtual bindings suitable for
the vendor's keyboard.

xmbind.alias can be modified to contain a user's per-vendor preferences,
and should be placed in the user's home directory.

A system wide xmbind.alias should be placed in /usr/lib/Xm/bindings, or
in a directory specified by the environment variable XMBINDDIR.

The vendor bindings files can be used to create user bindings files
in the home directory. They can also be used to create a .motifbind
file in the home directory, however, this method is not as flexible
as using xmbind.alias, since it is not sensitive to the vendor, and
therefore the keyboard type, of the X server.


These examples are provided, as is, only as a service to the vendors
and users.
