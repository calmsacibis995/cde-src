		   _____COMPONENT BUILD STATUS_____

This file was created to help us identify each component's critical
needs and ensure that the highest priority is given to the correct
dependencies.  Additionally the build process can be streamlined if we
know in advance that a particular component has not successfully built
on a particular reference platform.  Your participation in maintaining
this file will allow us to serve you better.  Please place this file
in each component source directory.

Instructions: Please fill in all appropriate spaces.  In the 'Build
              Matrix' check the appropriate boxes for each reference
              platform if your component successfully completes the
              build process (Builds), does NOT prematurely terminate
              on startup (Executes), and completes the provided test
              suites (Test Suite).

IBM :  An Imakefile was fixed today that had caused the build to fail
last night.  I checked off the Build, Executes, Test columns because
we checked in the tested fix this afternoon.
