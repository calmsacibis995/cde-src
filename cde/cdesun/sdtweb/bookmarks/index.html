<h1>
Sample Bookmarks
</h1>

<p>
The following sample bookmarks are also available as individual URL files in:
<blockquote>
/usr/dt/share/examples/bookmarks
</blockquote>
These bookmark or URL files are available from within the CDE File Manager.
</p>

<h2>Bookmarks - <i>URL Files and Attachments</i></h2>

<p>
Try using the CDE File Manager on the sample bookmarks folder and
see how URL files can act as bookmarks outside of a browser.
You can create your own bookmarks folder in your
home directory to manage your personal set of interesting
web locations.
</p>

<h3>Create Bookmarks using Drag-n-Drop</h3>

<p>
You can easily create new bookmarks using drag-n-drop.
Simply select the desired URL string (e.g. http://www.sun.com)
in a text window (that supports drag-n-drop),
drag it over to a CDE File Manager folder view and drop
it on the background.  This will created a new file called
Untitled.url with the URL location in it.  You can rename
that file with a more descriptive name if you want.
Double-clicking that file will bring it up in a web browser.
</p>

<h3>Share Bookmarks using E-Mail</h3>

<p>
Bookmarks can also be shared with others using e-mail attachments.
Simply compose an e-mail message and attach the Bookmark and
send the message.  The person who receives the message can
simply double-click on the URL attachment to view that location.
You can also use drag-n-drop to create URL attachments as
described above for files except you drop on the Mail attachment
pane instead.
