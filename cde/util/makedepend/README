The previous version of makedepend was not designed to 
handle #if statements.  The previous version would always
assume that the #if evaluated to false, and would take
the false case.  This turned out to be occaisionally wrong,
and problems with the build ensued.

I have dropped in the x11r5 sources onto the top of the tree
and have added cppfake.y.   This combination of stuff 
adds parsing capability of #if statements to makedepened
and fixes some other defects (which we might not see) that
were reported against the r4 makedepend.  It does, however,
supplant Nathan Meyer's performance fixes in the previous
version.
