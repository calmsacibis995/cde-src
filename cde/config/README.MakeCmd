The make command is explicitly not set by this configuration so as to
use whatever make is specified on the command line. There is a default
definition to MakeCmd in Imake.tmpl but this definition is never put
explicitly into the make macro MAKE.

To explicitly use MakeCmd add the following to your .cf file:
MAKE=MakeCmd


To change MakeCmd, define it in your .cf file.
