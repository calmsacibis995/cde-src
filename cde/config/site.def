 *                                                                           *
 *			   SITE-SPECIFIC DEFINITIONS                         *
 *                                                                           *
 * This file contains two halves, one included before the vendor-specific    *
 * configuration file (.cf file), and one included after the .cf file.       *
 * The before-half should be protected by #ifdef BeforeVendorCF, and the     *
 * after-half should be protected by #ifdef AfterVendorCF.                   *
 *                                                                           *
 * The before-half should only set things that the .cf file depends on.      *
 * For the .cf files shipped in this release, the main variable in this      *
 * category is HasGcc.                                                       *
 *                                                                           *
 * The after-half should contain all other definitions.  For example,        *
 * place your ProjectRoot definition here.  Beware that several of the       *
 * .cf files supplied by vendors have a ProjectRoot already defined, so      *
 * you may need to #undef it first.                                          *
 *                                                                           *
 * OS Major and Minor version numbers should be changed directly in the .cf  *
 * file, not overridden in site.def.                                         *
 *                                                                           *
