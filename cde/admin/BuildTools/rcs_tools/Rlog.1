.SH NAME
Rlog \- OSSD-CV RCS check out with remote capabilities.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Rlog
.RI [ \|options\| ]
.I file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rlog
is a perl front-end to the
.I rlog
.SM RCS
program
and is used exactly like the original RCS executable.
.I Rlog
prints information about
.SM RCS
files.
Files ending in
.I ,v
are
.SM RCS
files; all others are working files.
If a working file is given,
.I Rlog
tries to find the corresponding
.SM RCS
file first in directory
.IR ./RCS ,
then in the current directory, as explained in
.IR Rcsintro (1).
.PP
.I Rlog
prints the following information for each
.SM RCS
file:
.SM RCS
file name, working file name, head (i.e., the number
of the latest revision on the trunk), access list, locks,
symbolic names, suffix, total number of revisions,
number of revisions selected for printing, and
descriptive text.
This is followed by entries for the selected revisions in
reverse chronological order for each branch.
For each revision,
.I Rlog
prints revision number, author, date/time, state, number of
lines added/deleted (with respect to the previous revision),
locker of the revision (if any), and log message.
Without options,
.I Rlog
prints complete information.
The options below restrict this output.
.SS Options
.I Rlog
recognizes the following options:
.RS
.TP 15
.I -d dates
Print information about revisions
whose check-in date and time fall within the ranges
given by the semicolon-separated list of
.IR dates .
A range of the form
.IC d1 < d2
or
.IC d2 > d1
selects the revisions that were deposited between
.I d1
and
.I d2
(inclusive).
A range of the form
.I < d
or
.IC d >
selects all revisions dated
.I d
or earlier.
A range of the form
.IC d <
or
.I > d
selects all revisions dated
.I d
or later.
A range of the form
.I d
selects the single, latest revision dated
.I d
or earlier.
The date/time strings
.IR d ,
.IR d1 ,
and
.I d2
are in the free format explained in
.IR co (1).
Quoting is normally necessary, especially for
.I <
and
.IR > .
Note that the separator is a semicolon.
.TP
.I -h
Print only
.SM RCS
file name, working file name, head,
access list, locks, symbolic names, and suffix.
.TP
.IR -l [\|\f2lockers\fP\|]
Print information about locked revisions.
If the comma-separated list
.I lockers
of login names is given,
only the revisions
locked by the given login names are printed.
If the list is omitted, all locked revisions are printed.
.TP
.I -L
Ignore
.SM RCS
files that have no locks set; convenient in combination with
.IR -R ,
.IR -h ,
or
.IR -l .
.TP
.I -r revisions
Print information about revisions given in the comma-separated list
.I revisions
of revisions and ranges.
A range
.IR rev1 - rev2
means revisions
.I rev1
to
.I rev2
on the same branch,
.I - rev
means revisions from the beginning of the branch up to and including
.IR rev ,
and
.IC rev -
means revisions starting with
.I rev
to the head of the branch containingw
.IR rev .
An argument that is a branch means all revisions on that branch.
A range of branches means all revisions on the branches in that range.
.TP
.I -R
Print only the name of the
.SM RCS
file; convenient for translating a working file name into an
.SM RCS
file name.
.TP
.I -s states
Print information about revisions
whose state attributes match one of the states
given in the comma-separated list
.IR states .
.TP
.I -t
Print the same as
.IR -h ,
plus the descriptive text.
.TP
.IR -w [\|\f2logins\fP\|]
Prints information about revisions checked in by users
whose login names appearing in the comma-separated list
.IR logins .
If
.I logins
is omitted, the user's login is assumed.
.RE
.PP
.I Rlog
prints the intersection of the revisions selected with the options
.IR -d ,
.IR -l ,
.IR -s ,
.IR -w ,
and
.IR -r .
.SH EXAMPLES
Print the names of all
.SM RCS
files 
that have locks:
.IP
.I "Rlog -L -R *
.PP
Print the headers of those files:
.IP
.I "Rlog -L -h *"
.PP
Print the headers plus the log messages of the locked revisions:
.IP
.I "Rlog -L -l *
.PP
Print complete log information:
