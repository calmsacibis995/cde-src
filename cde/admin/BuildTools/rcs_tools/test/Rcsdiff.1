.SH NAME
Rcsdiff \- RCS diff tool with remote capabilities.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Rcsdiff
.RI [ \|options\| ]
.I file ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Rcsdiff
is a perl front-end to the
.I rcsdiff
.SM RCS
program
and is used exactly like the original RCS executable.
It is most commonly used with no options or the
.I -r
option.
.I Rcsdiff
compares two revisions of each given
.SM RCS
file and creates output very similar to
.I diff
(see
.IR diff (1)).
A file name ending in
.I ,v
is an
.SM RCS
file name, otherwise it is a working file name.
.I Rcsdiff
derives the working file name from the
.SM RCS
file name and vice versa, as explained in
.IR rcsintro (5).
Pairs consisting of both an
.SM RCS
and a working file name can also be specified.
.PP
.I Rcsdiff
recognizes the following options:
.RS
.TP 6
.I -p
This option is only useful when the RCS directory is remote. It has the
same effect as sending stderr output to /dev/null.  This is useful when
using the diffs described below as input to patch programs or other
commands.
.TP
.I -b
Same as described in
.IR diff (1);
.TP
.I -e
Same as described in
.IR diff (1);
.TP
.I -f
Same as described in
.IR diff (1);
.TP
.I -h
Same as described in
.IR diff (1);
.TP
.I -n
Generate an edit script of the format used by
.SM RCS.
.TP
.IR -c [\|\f2n\fP\|]
Generate a diff with lines of context.
The default is to present 3 lines of context.
To change, specify
.IR n ;
for example,
.I -c10
gives 10 lines of context.
.IP
.I -c
modifies the output format slightly from the normal
.IR diff (1)
output.
The ``context'' output begins
with identification of the files involved
and their creation dates,
then each change is separated by a line with a dozen
.I *
(asterisks).
Lines removed from
.I file1
are marked with
.I -
(dashes); those added to
.I file2
with
.I +
(pluses).
Lines that are changed from one file to the
other are marked in both files with
.I !
(exclamation marks).
.RE
.PP
If both
.I rev1
and
.I rev2
are omitted,
.I Rcsdiff
compares the latest revision on the trunk
with the contents of the corresponding working file.
This is useful for determining what was changed since the last check-in.
.PP
If
.I rev1
is given, but
.I rev2
is omitted,
.I Rcsdiff
compares revision
.I rev1
of the
.SM RCS
file with the contents of the corresponding working file.
.PP
If both
.I rev1
and
.I rev2
are given,
.I Rcsdiff
compares revisions
.I rev1
and
.I rev2
of the
.SM RCS
file.
.PP
Both
.I rev1
and
.I rev2
can be given numerically or symbolically.
.SH USING PATHS IN RCS
When using the regular RCS commands(
.IR Ci,
.IR Co,
.IR Rcs,
.IR Rlog,
.IR Rcsdiff),
You have the ability to control which source file(the regular file
you are working with) and RCS file(the RCS/filename,v version of the
regular file) are used for the command. E.g.
.nf
PATH                               FILES USED by RCS
io.c                               ./io.c ./RCS/io.c,v
RCS/io.c,v                         ./io.c ./RCS/io.c,v
somepath/RCS/io.c,v                ./io.c somepath/RCS/io.c,v
apath/io.c apath/RCS/io.c,v        apath/io.c apath/RCS/io.c,v
apath/io.c anotherpath/RCS/io.c,v  apath/io.c anotherpath/RCS/io.c,v
apath/io.c                         error
.SH EXAMPLES
Compare the latest trunk revision of
.SM RCS
file
.I f.c,v
and the contents of working file
.IR f.c :
.IP
.I Rcsdiff  f.c
.PP
Compare revision 1.1 of f.c with revision 1.3:
.IP
.I Rcsdiff -r1.1 -r1.3 f.c
.PP
Do the same from any directory assuming f.c's RCS vault  is in 
somedir:
.IP
.I Rcsdiff -r1.1 -r1.3 somedir/RCS/f.c,v
.PP
Wildcards can be used for the RCS vault path:
.IP
.I "Rcsdiff  somedir/RCS/[ij]*.?,v"
