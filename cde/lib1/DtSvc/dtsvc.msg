$ ***** NOTE FOR MESSAGE CATALOG TRANSLATORS *****
$ 
$ There may be three types of messages in this file:
$
$  1. Messages that appear in dialogs or are displayed to the user.
$
$     These messages are the default and they should ALL BE LOCALIZED.
$     Note that these messages do NOT have any identification (see the
$     comments for type 2 and 3 below).
$
$  2. Messages that only appear in the DT error log file ($HOME/.dt/errorlog).
$
$     The localization of these messages is OPTIONAL.  These messages are
$     identified by the following:
$
$  MESSAGES xx-yy IN SET zz WILL ONLY APPEAR IN THE DT ERRORLOG FILE
$
$  3. Messages that should not be localized.  
$
$     These messages are identified by the following:
$
$  DO NOT TRANSLATE or CHANGE or LOCALIZE MESSAGES xx-yy from set zz
